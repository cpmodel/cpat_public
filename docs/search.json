    "text": "Foreword\n\nWhy CPAT?\nThe world faces the interconnected challenges of accelerating development and poverty reduction while addressing the climate challenge. Current policies, including climate commitments are not yet aligned with the Paris Agreement’s goal to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”. Much more action will be needed, despite a backdrop of multiple crises, slow growth, high debt and limited fiscal space. To meet these temperature levels, global greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by 21 to 43 percent by 2030 compared to 2019 (IPCC, AR6, Summary for Policymakers). Such an unprecedented rate of decarbonization necessitates climate mitigation policies across countries, notably carbon pricing, fossil fuel subsidy reform, renewable subsidies, feebates, emission rate regulations, and public investments. To design and implement effective, efficient, and equitable policies governments need tools to assess economic, environmental, fiscal, and social impacts. To support this effort, the IMF and World Bank are making their joint Climate Policy Assessment Tool (CPAT) available to governments.\nAmong the proposed climate policies in the tool, carbon pricing offers an opportunity for countries to enhance their mobilization of domestic resources and improve the efficiency of the tax system, while creating an incentive for all economic actors – firms, investors, and households – to reduce their carbon emissions and favor greener technologies and behaviors. Combined with appropriate regulations and investments, carbon pricing is a key policy for countries to align their development and climate objectives. In particular, carbon pricing can offer a more efficient option to raise much-needed tax revenues, and generate short-term economic benefits through less distortive tax systems or enhanced investment in government services and infrastructure. It also provides financial resources that can be deployed to protect the poor and vulnerable populations against negative implications and avoid regressive impacts. Other development benefits include improvements in human health due to the co-emission of carbon emissions and local pollutants, and reductions in congestion and traffic-related accidents, for example as a result of a modal shift from private vehicles to public transit or soft modes.\n\n\nWhat is CPAT\nThe Climate Policy Assessment Tool (CPAT) was developed to help countries provide a rapid evaluation of the potential impacts of climate policy reforms. As a global tool covering more than 180 countries, CPAT can be used as a one-stop-shop by anyone who is interested in a quick diagnostic of the potential benefits of a carbon price reform across multiple key dimensions, including not only emissions reduction potential and macroeconomic aggregates but also air pollution and health, road fatalities and congestion, and distributional impacts. It allows for the rapid quantification of impacts of climate mitigation policies, including on energy demand, prices, emissions, revenues, welfare, GDP, households and industries, local air pollution and health, and many other metrics. This documentation describes the CPAT model, its data sources, key assumptions, and caveats."

    "section": "Why 400 pages of documentation?",
    "text": "Why 400 pages of documentation?\nCPAT is comprised of several economic models. Economic models describe a simplified reality and so they are, by definition, subject to considerable uncertainty. When interpreting the results of a model, knowing the underlying assumptions is critical. For this reason, several steps have been taken to improve the transparency of CPAT. First, the tool is spreadsheet-based with data and formulas readily accessible within the tool. Second, the tool is accompanied by a detailed 400-page documentation of the methodology which includes important caveats and cautions related to interpretation and data issues.\nCPAT is designed to be a global public good. In a constantly evolving world, the tool will need continuous updating and upgrading. By putting together and releasing the detailed CPAT methodology, it is our hope that any interested party can adapt the tool for their own needs and contribute to its further development."

    "text": "1.1 What climate policies can be assessed using CPAT?\n\n1.1.1 Carbon Pricing Policies\nThe table below summarizes the climate policies options available in CPAT. The first column displayed the number corresponding to the policy in CPAT Excel-sheet. The carbon tax, ETS, feebate and energy efficiency regulations are qualified general policies as they cover all sectors. Nevertheless, exemptions can be applied for individual fuels and sectors (with the option to phase out exemptions over time). Other policies are sector- or fuel-specific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\nPolicy coverage\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nBaseline\nNo climate policy implemented, except from those already captured by the prices data (e.g. existing ETS or carbon tax).\n\n\nGeneral policies\n\n\n\n\n2\nCarbon tax\nThis policy represents a carbon tax applied to the supply of all fossil fuels in proportion to their carbon content. It is modeled by adding to the pre-existing tax on a particular fuel a charge equal to the product of the CO2 emissions factor for that fuel and the tax rate on CO2.\n\n\n3\nETS\nThese policies are modeled in a similar way to a tax (CPAT is deterministic and does not capture uncertainty over emissions prices associated with ETSs). That is, CPAT requires the user to estimate the likely price of an ETS and then impose that to find the emissions reduction.1\n\n\n4\nFeebates\nFeebates provide a revenue-neutral, sliding scale of fees on activities (like power generation) or products (like vehicles). Activities or products with above average emission rates pay a net tax; activities or products with below average emission rates get net revenues.\n\n\n5\nEnergy efficiency regulations\nThese policies reduce the emissions or energy intensity of a sector but without the same demand response (e.g., reductions in VKT) as under carbon pricing because they do not involve the pass through of carbon tax revenues (or allowance rents) in higher prices (e.g., for electricity or gasoline) – they also produce a partially offsetting increase in emissions through the rebound effect.\n\n\nFuel or sector-specific policies\n\n\n\n\n6\nCoal excise\nThe coal excise tax is a carbon tax (in the sense of it being defined per ton CO2) only on coal.\n\n\n7\nRoad fuel tax\nTaxes imposed on all fuels in the road transport sector.\n\n\n8\nElectricity emissions tax\nThis policy imposes a carbon tax on the electricity sector.\n\n\n9\nPower feebate\nThis policy covers power supply feebates if the engineer model is selected and covers power usage feebates if the elasticity model is selected.\n\n\n10\nElectricity excise\nThis policy translates into a tax per kWh of electricity used. The tax is set via the standard carbon tax interface. The tax in $/tCO2 is mapped to one per kWh using the year one emission factor as a conversion factor.\n\n\n11\nVehicle fuel economy\nThis imposes shadow prices (similar to a feebate) in the vehicle sector.\n\n\n12\nResidential efficiency regulations\nSimilar to the energy efficiency regulations, but it only applies to the residential sector.\n\n\n13\nIndustrial efficiency regulations\nSimilar to the energy efficiency regulations, but it only applies to the industrial sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform Policies.\nIn addition to these policies, CPAT allows the user to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and reform regulated prices. See the relevant sections below.\n\n\n1.1.3 Power Sector Policies\nThe power sector model contains policies that adjust the cost of capital, adjust Power Purchase Agreements etc. See the relevant sections below."

    "text": "1.2 Quick Start Guide: Climate Policy Assessment Tool (CPAT)\nWelcome to CPAT! This guide aims to show you how to use CPAT, give you an idea of some common issues, and indicate CPAT’s data needs.\nWhat is CPAT? CPAT is a tool for analyzing the impacts of carbon pricing and fossil fuel reforms along several economic and non-economic dimensions.\nOpening CPAT: CPAT is a spreadsheet-based tool. You need Excel 2016 or later. Since CPAT is a relatively large spreadsheet, please close other apps. Please ensure ‘Automatic Calculations’ are turned on (File &gt; Options &gt; Formulas).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Automatic calculations\n\n\nNavigating CPAT: Please, navigate first to the Dashboard tab.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Navigation CPAT\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Input: Country and Proposed Policy Trajectory\nPolicy Input Area: At the top left, you see various input cells. The yellow cells are user-editable. Categorical cells can be altered by clicking the small down arrow. By clicking on the cell which currently shows Carbon tax, you can select a different carbon pricing policy (e.g., an ETS), which comes with sectoral exemptions pre-set. All policies are defined by the carbon price. The carbon price trajectory is defined by the introduction date (here 2022), the start level (here $50/tCO2), the target level of the carbon price (here $75/tCO2), and the year that this target level will be met (here 2030).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Country and policy input area\n\n\nCarbon Price Trajectory: To check that your suggested carbon tax is in place, please see the policy strength graph under Key inputs and outputs. On default settings, the policy is extended linearly beyond the end date. The dotted lines in the left-hand graph show the recommended range for a carbon price recommended by the High-level Commission on Carbon Pricing. The right-hand graph shows the policy’s coverage, including any exemptions (see later for defining exemptions)\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Carbon price trajectory\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Output: Emissions, Revenues, and Co-Benefits\nThe main outputs are shown under Key inputs and outputs in Panel B. From the left, these graphs show:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Key inputs and outputs\n\n\n\nGHG emissions relative to baseline (dashed line) & NDC target (dotted horizontal line)\nFiscal revenues (before recycling of funds)\nImpact on projected GDP growth\nImpacts on households (note: only countries for which household data are available)\nCo-benefits: averted air pollution & road accident deaths\nTotal monetized benefits from the policy\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Sense-Checking\nThe CPAT team is constantly working to keep CPAT up to date, but CPAT is not bulletproof. You should run a few sense-checks as described below. Some of these checks relate to the reliability of input data. Many CPAT users can access national data sources. For continuous improvement of the tool, we would very much appreciate it if such data sources could be shared with us in case data is either missing or substantively different from what is currently in CPAT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck 1: Start by ensuring that the graphs show and update when you change carbon price inputs (i.e., there should be no errors in panel B: all graphs should show except, for some countries, the fourth graph on the impact on households).\n\n\n\nDefaults for parameters: Click the + button for advanced settings.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: The ‘+’ button\n\n\nThis expandable panel contains a wide range of parameter settings and adjustments.\nDefault parameters are indicated with an asterisk (e.g., ‘Base*’). Suppose you change a parameter away from its default setting. In that case, the color changes from yellow to orange. An indicator at the bottom of the ‘Miscellaneous’ section indicates the number of parameters that have departed from default values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck 2: Check how many defaults are different from expected. For default use, the line at the bottom of the Miscellaneous row should be blank/invisible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of all settings set to default values\nExample of two settings NOT set to default values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Exemptions\nOne can exempt any fuels and sectors from the carbon tax (if unticked). So, if, e.g., Kerosene and Cement are unticked, all Kerosene is exempted (independent of the sector), and all Cement energy use is exempt (independent of fuel).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck 3: Ensure that all checkboxes are ticked for full policy coverage (recommended) or unticked as desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Phase-out exemptions, subsidies, and revenue recycling\nOn the right-hand side at the top of the dashboard, the user can change settings relating to the phase-out of exemptions, price controls, and subsidies. It also includes supplementing the policy with renewable energy subsidies and the use of revenues. For revenue recycling, there are five options: labor tax reductions, corporate tax reductions, public investment, current spending, and compensatory transfers to households.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Phase-out exemptions, subsidies, and revenue recycling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck 4: The phase-out of exemptions, price controls, and subsidies, as well as the use of revenue, should be as desired by the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.6 NDC data\nCPAT includes data on countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the UNFCCC. The ‘NDCs’ Tab summarizes the NDC baseline data for your country. As countries may be updating their NDCs, please check online in the UNFCCC NDC Registry if the information shown is up to date, and in line with the latest submitted version. If not, please, copy the table, fill it out, and send to the team.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: NDC data\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck 5: Verify that NDC data are up to date.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.7 Prices\nPanel A under the Mitigation module (macro & energy effects) includes a table showing average fuel prices and tax-induced percentage changes. Price changes depend on carbon content as well as pre-existing price distortions (e.g., subsidies).\nNote that a significant increase in the price of coal is expected in many countries, even under a moderate carbon tax. For example, $80/t carbon tax with a coal emission factor at ~0.1 tCO2/GJ would correspond to $8/GJ carbon tax. If baseline (subsidized) coal prices were $2/GJ with the subsidy around $0.5/GJ, prices would increase 400%, even without subsidies phase-out. A more moderate situation is shown in the table to the right for Poland, where we see the price of coal increase by 164.8%.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Fuel prices\n\n\nPrices data quality: Look at the heat map to check the quality of the underlying price data. Information is color-coded (see the legend and suggested actions in the map): green shades mean reliable data sources, and yellow/orange cells mean that the users will have to check and confirm prices data.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Prices data quality\n\n\nPrices data form: if the user believes they have better prices data, they can choose to use ‘manual’ prices in calculations and fill the ‘manual inputs’ tab in CPAT. Also we recommend filling and sending this form to the CPAT team so we can update the global CPAT version accordingly.\n\n\n\nCheck 6: Are prices and percentage changes reasonable?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.8 Distributional consumption effects on households\nFor distributional results, first, check if household data for your country is already included in CPAT; if not, process your microdata following the Codebook and scripts (3-4 days’ resource commitment); if yes, define how to transfer revenues (drop-down menu under ‘Policy options’); adjust accordingly if red flags appear. If ‘No’ adjustment for behavioral/structural change is selected, the price increases are fully passed on to the consumer, which may overestimate consumption effects (i.e., the tax-induced mitigation effect is not considered). Alternatively, choose to factor in decile-specific, price-driven demand adjustments/elasticities.\nChoose whether distributional effects are expressed based on decile-specific mean or median consumption data: While median effects are more representative, some fuels may not be shown if &gt; 50% of households report zero or missing expenses (e.g., due to poor data quality). We recommend that effects not be modeled further than five years out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck 7: Make an informed choice on mean/median representation and modelling results without taking into account reduced prices due to behavioral adjustments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: Distributional settings\n\n\n\n\n1.2.9 Contribution of sources to ambient particulate matter\nDoes the contribution by sector look reasonable? A “reasonable number” should be above 20% and below 90% for most countries. The sectorial distribution could be compared to country level information, if available. If the contribution does not look appropriate when comparing with local information available, the user can change the modeling approach.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure 1.12: Air pollution settings and sources of ambient particulate matter\n\n\nThe option “Manual-FASST” will allow the user to input their own information, in “Manual inputs tab”. In this case, the user would need to input the contribution of each sector to ambient PM2.5. The recommended default option is “Avg. iF and LS FASST”, which uses the average between the intake fractions model and the Local study-FASST approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck 8: Check sectors’ contribution to ambient PM2.5 and adjust modeling approach if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.10 Road transport co-benefits\nIn the current version of CPAT, total fatalities from road accidents in 2020 are projected based on 2011-2016 data from World Road Statistics. It is recommended that the user checks the validity of this estimate using local data sources, if available, noting that the underlying assumptions can vary significantly from one data source to another. The user might also want to cross-check “forecasted” total distance driven in 2020 (e.g., around 200 billion vehicle-km for Poland as shown in the left-hand side figure) against national statistics, if available.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure 1.13: Transport co-benefits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck 9: Check data validity on road accidents and total distance driven.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.11 Currency used in CPAT\nCPAT is presented in constant US dollars (USD). Monetary variables are presented in CPAT are in USD real terms. CPAT distinguishes between the base year – the first year of model calculations (at the time of writing, 2019) – and the year of real terms constant dollars used (at the time of writing, 2021). These settings are defined in the dashboard around cell G60.\nCPAT converts between local currencies and US dollars at year of real terms constant dollars (i.e. 2021) exchange rates, and then uses (projected or historical) US inflation indices to deflate in time. For more information on macroeconomic data sources, please see Appendix A.\n\n\n1.2.12 Energy Units in CPAT\nCPAT uses commonly used units where possible, rather than adopting a fully consistent (SI) approach:\n\nFor primary and final energy consumption, we use thousand tons of oil equivalent (ktoe) per year.\nFor power consumption and generation, we use GWh per year (or TWh per year in some graphs).\n\nFor prices we use different units depending on the fuel type:\n\nFor coal, natural gas and biomass, we use $/GJ;\nFor gasoline, diesel, kerosene and LPG, we use $/liter;\nFor crude oil and other oil products we use $/bbl (dollars per barrel); and\nFor electricity we use $/kWh."

    "text": "1.3 In-depth use of CPAT\n\n1.3.1 Using CPAT\n\n1.3.1.1 Running CPAT\nCPAT is a large Excel file of about 20Mb in compressed Excel binary (.xlsb) format. Its computational needs are substantial, and you should normally not expect to have other memory-intensive programs open. After changing a policy or other input it should take a few seconds to update (you will need to have calculations turned on). You can tell CPAT is working by the ‘graphs updating’. For example, when you change the country and the carbon price input (e.g. by changing cell I6 of the dashboard), the emissions trajectory (around row 44 of the dashboard) will adjust.\nCPAT requires a modern version of Excel (2016 at least) and is tested on PC, rather than the Apple Macintosh version of Excel. You should use the desktop, rather than the web version of Excel.\n\n\n1.3.1.2 Navigating CPAT\nYou can navigate around CPAT by clicking different tabs. There are three overarching tabs: Cover (this section), Dashboard (the main tab, next section), and User Inputs (following subsection). For the rest of this chapter, we then cover the mitigation module in more detail. After the four main modules of CPAT (mitigation, distribution, air pollution and transport), code readable inputs and outputs of CPAT are presented in MTinput and MToutput tabs (outlined later in this subsection), followed by various data sources driving CPAT, ordered by tab. To get from a graph to the underlying data set driving it, please click on the graph title cell (just above the graph itself) and then use the keyboard to type Ctrl-$ on a PC. This will zoom across to the relevant results area and select the cell containing the title. Have a look around (usually below the selected cell) to find the respective data.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.14: CPAT Tabs\n\n\nThe subsections can be ‘grouped’ so only one line of results is shown, or ‘ungrouped’ so that all calculations are shown. To group, click the small ‘1’ at the top left of the main window. To ungroup one subsection, click the small + sign on the left-hand side. To ungroup all (not usually needed), click the small ‘2’ in the same place as the ‘1’.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.15: Grouping and Ungrouping CPAT sections\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1.3 CPAT visual conventions\nCPAT adopts various visual conventions to make the model easier to follow and code. User inputs are colored yellow. Calculations are white. CPAT codes are typically in blue. Tan cells (both lighter and darker shades) represent formulae that are different from those around them and so cannot be dragged or dragged-onto. The cover tab describes these visual conventions.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.16: CPAT Cover Page\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 The CPAT dashboard tab\nCPAT is controlled by its dashboard which provides the main policy, modelling and parameter inputs, and the main outputs from the policy or policies chosen. The dashboard allows the user to input choices regarding the policy under investigation (such as a carbon tax trajectory, with different options for exemptions and recycling of the revenues, or fossil fuel subsidy reform). The dashboard also has options to allow the user to make different modeling choices (e.g., alternative data sources). The tool produces a series of graphs of the impact of the policy scenarios on several variables, including:\n\nPolicy inputs and headline overall effects;\nMitigation and energy use (i.e., the reduction in Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, changes in energy consumption); macroeconomic and fiscal aggregates (GDP, tax revenues);\nDistributional impacts (per income decile, but also urban/rural, and industrial outputs);\nAir pollution and health (concentration, but also mortality and morbidity); and\nTransport (road fatalities and congestion).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.17: Illustration of the CPAT 1.0 Dashboard (partial view, see the excel file for the full dashboard)\n\n\nIn the dashboard, the policy scenario and the baseline are sometimes shown on the same graph, with the baseline shown with a dashed line.\nMany CPAT settings have default values. These are usually denoted by an asterix suffix – e.g. “Yes*“.\n\n1.3.2.1 Policy input area: Country and proposed policy trajectory\nAt the top left of CPAT, you see various input cells. The yellow cells are user editable. Categorical cells can be altered by clicking the small down arrow. By clicking on the cell which currently shows carbon tax, you can select a different carbon pricing policy (e.g., an ETS), which comes with sectoral exemptions pre-set. All policies are defined by the carbon price. The carbon price trajectory is defined by the introduction date (here 2022), the start level (here $50/tCO2), the target level of the carbon price (here $75/tCO2), and the year that this target level will be met (here 2030).\nOn the right-hand side at the top of the dashboard, the user can change settings relating to the phase-out of exemptions, price controls, and subsidies. One can exempt any fuels and sectors from the carbon tax (if unticked). So, if, for example, Kerosene and Cement are unticked, all Kerosene is exempted (independent of the sector), and all Cement energy use is exempted (independent of fuel). It is necessary to ensure that all checkboxes are ticked for full policy coverage (recommended) or unticked as desired. It also includes supplementing policies with renewable energy subsidies and the use of revenues. For revenue recycling, there are five options: labor tax reductions, corporate tax reductions, public investment, current spending, and compensatory transfers to households. The phase-out of exemptions, price controls, and subsidies, as well as the use of revenue, should be as desired by the user.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.18: Phase-out policies\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.2 Policy inputs panel\nThe first panel shows the result of the policy inputs. This includes Carbon Price Trajectory: To check that the suggested carbon tax is in place, please see the policy strength graph under Key inputs and outputs. On default settings, the policy is extended linearly beyond the end date. The dotted lines in the left-hand graph show the range for a carbon price recommended by the High-level Commission on Carbon Pricing. The right-hand graph shows the policy’s coverage, including any exemptions (see later for defining exemptions).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.19: Policy design\n\n\nThere are further graphs in this panel, indicating the use of policy coverage, use of revenue, baseline GDP and energy price assumptions, income and price elasticity assumptions.\nThe description of both the advanced settings and the settings of the power models are presented in Appendix F - Parameter options in the mitigation module.\n\n\n1.3.2.3 Overview of policies accounted for in CPAT\nCPAT covers carbon pricing, taxes, feebates2, efficiency policies, fossil fuel subsidy reform, and power-sector-specific policies (e.g., Power Pricing Agreement reform). The main carbon pricing and fossil fuel subsidy reform policies are selected in the main dashboard.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.20: Main Policy Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.4 Economy-wide carbon pricing options in CPAT\nCPAT accounts for an extensive list of carbon pricing instruments. These can be selected in the ‘Policy’ box shown below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.21: Select Policy, CPAT Dashboard\n\n\n\n1.3.2.4.1 Carbon taxation\nThis policy represents a carbon tax applied to the supply of all fossil fuels in proportion to their carbon content. It is modeled by adding to the pre-existing tax on a particular fuel a charge equal to the product of the CO2 emissions factor for that fuel and the tax rate on CO2. The carbon tax can be comprehensive in applying to all fuels and sectors, or exemptions can be applied for individual fuels and sectors (with the option to phase out exemptions over time).\nTo the extent they are passed on, carbon taxes are reflected in higher prices for electricity. The increase in electricity prices has two components: (i) the pure abatement costs which reflect increase in generation costs per unit due to the shifting to cleaner, but costlier, generation fuels; and (ii) the tax on remaining emissions per unit of production (or carbon charges on fossil fuel inputs per unit of production). The second part can be rebated either by a dedicated policy (see power feebate below) or by a modification of a comprehensive carbon tax.\nFor carbon taxation and for the other comprehensive carbon pricing schemes, the user can define sectoral or fuel exemptions using the check boxes in the main dashboard.\n\n\n1.3.2.4.2 Emission Trading Systems\nThese policies are modeled in a similar way to a tax (CPAT is deterministic and does not capture uncertainty over emissions prices associated with ETSs). That is, CPAT requires the user to estimate the likely price of an ETS and then impose that to find the emissions reduction. That said, there is also a ‘goal seek’ functionality which allows one to change the price in order to meet a particular emissions target in 2030. Because CPAT is set up without macros, the actual goal seek needs to be done by hand set up by the user using in-built Excel goal seek or seeker routine.\nA scalar adjustment, set at a default value of 0.9, is applied to the emissions price, which however implies a (moderately smaller) behavioral response from the ETS compared with the equivalent carbon tax with the same price. This scalar could represent: (i) exclusion of small emitting firms from an ETS applied downstream to large firms in the power and industry sectors; (ii) higher price uncertainty under an ETS compared with a tax which potentially dampens investment incentives for low-carbon technologies; and (iii) grandfathering of allowances to incumbent firms creating barriers to new entrants and potentially forestalling innovation.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.22: Goal Seek to Determine (ETS or Carbon Tax) Carbon Price consistent with emissions target\n\n\nIn the dashboard, a goal seek tool is available in order to determine the carbon price matching the emissions target. The goal seek is set around cell Y192 of the dashboard near the panel D of the mitigation section. To use it:\n\nConnect cell I6 (Target level of carbon price) to be equal to call AC192 (so that the carbon tax is in the same location as the emissions);\nDefine the coverage of the emissions target using the boxes from cell AC194 downwards;\nDefine the coverage percentage of industry in the target;\nDefine the percentage reduction or absolute emissions target; and\nModify cell AC192 until cells AB214 and AD214 are as close as possible or set up a goal seek to minimize cell AE214 by changing the target carbon price (cell I6).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.23: Goal Seek to Determine (ETS or Carbon Tax) Carbon Price consistent with emissions target\n\n\nThe goal seek only works for 2030 emissions and can be used for NDC or for ETS targeting.\nNote that CPAT models new ETSs and Carbon Taxes separately from existing ETSs and Carbon Tax. For the European Union countries for example, the existing ETS price are projected forward: the growth rate in this projection can be set in the dashboard. It should also be noted that new ETSs are modeled as a sector being ‘in’ or ‘out’, whereas existing ETSs use an aggregated percentage of industry and power based on aggregated coverage data. When a sector is partly included, the carbon price is proportionally reduced by the coverage proportion and the reduced carbon price is applied to the whole sector.\n\n\n1.3.2.4.3 Feebates\nIn their pure form, feebates provide a revenue-neutral, sliding scale of fees on activities (like power generation) or products (like vehicles). Activities or products with above average emission rates pay a net tax; activities or products with below average emission rates get net revenues. When a feebate is constructed by a carbon tax plus a rebate based on output (e.g., kWh electricity produced, steel produced, etc.) this is called Output Based Rebating (OBR). But there are other feebates differing from this form, for example when the feebate is on the initial purchase decision, rather the ongoing use (e.g., in the case of vehicles).\nIn most cases, feebates are modeled through shadow prices. Shadow prices are modeled not by a change in prices per se but rather a price-like adjustments to energy use equations. These shadow prices affect the efficiency channel of the energy use (typically about half the overall price-based effect) but not the usage channel.\nPower supply feebates are modeled as a rebated carbon tax (i.e. a carbon tax that only increases power prices through pure abatement costs, not the cost of emissions).\n\n\n\n1.3.2.5 Sectoral carbon pricing and taxation policies\nCoal excise tax. The coal excise tax is a carbon tax (in the sense of it being defined per ton CO2) only on coal.\nElectricity emission tax. This imposes a carbon tax on the electricity sector.\nElectricity excise. This is a tax per kWh of electricity used. We set the tax via the standard carbon tax interface. The tax in $/tCO2 is mapped to one per kWh using the year one emission factor as a conversion factor. However, this is only a tax on end users of electricity, it does not distinguish between different ways of generating electricity, incentivizing only electricity demand and not the composition of electricity supply.\nPower feebate. This policy covers power supply feebates if the engineer model is selected and covers power usage feebates if the elasticity model is selected.\nVehicle fuel economy. This imposes shadow prices (similar to a feebate) in the vehicle sector.\nRoad fuel tax. Taxes imposed on all fuels in the road transport sector.\nSectoral fossil fuel excise taxes. These can be modeled by the user, using this setting in the dashboard. This allows the user to set sector- and fuel-specific carbon taxes.3\n\n\n\nFigure 1.24: Excise Reform Settings\n\n\nThe actual sectoral-fuel tax rates are set in the ‘Manual Inputs’ tab.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.25: Excise Reform Settings\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.6 Regulations and subsidies\nEnergy efficiency regulations. CPAT can model CO2 emission rate standards per kWh of power generation, per unit of production for individual industries, or per vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) for vehicles, or energy efficiency standards for electricity demand, and energy use in the industry, transport, and building sectors. These policies reduce the emissions or energy intensity of a sector but without the same demand response (e.g., reductions in VKT) as under carbon pricing because they do not involve the pass through of carbon tax revenues (or allowance rents) in higher prices (e.g., for electricity or gasoline) – they also produce a partially offsetting increase in emissions through the rebound effect. In particular, CPAT focuses on residential and industrial efficiency regulations.\nClean technology subsidies. Subsidies for renewable generation are modeled in CPAT by a subsidy providing a proportionate reduction in the per unit generation cost for renewables. Subsidies for electric vehicles (EV) are not explicitly modeled in CPAT.\n\n\n1.3.2.7 Fossil fuel subsidy reform and regulated price reform\nCPAT includes extensive capabilities to reform fossil fuel subsidies. For each form of subsidy (i.e., producer-side and consumer-side) one can select the phase out check box and then the number of years to phase out that subsidy. CPAT also includes some estimations of price controls, which can also be phased out (although there are interaction effects so doing both at the same time is not advised). We recommend the default assumptions for fossil fuel subsidies to be checked and/or replaced by the user (user defined subsidies are defined in the manual inputs tab and the dashboard or mitigation tab – the dom_prices tab contains the default assumptions on prices and subsidies). For more information, see the Section Fuel prices, taxes and subsidies and Sub-Section Fiscal revenues of this chapter. Note that whether fossil fuel subsidy reform is included in the baseline is in the advanced settings. The user should check the following setting:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.26: Excise Reform Settings\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.8 Power sector-specific policies\nCPAT has the capability to adjust the maximum rate of renewable scale up. This is set for default to 2% for wind and 2% for solar, meaning that we could add (gross of retirements) additional generation equal to 2% of the total for each generation type. For many countries, this growth rate is too ambitious, and a tighter cap will be needed. On the other hand, more ambitious renewables policies could lead to this cap being loosened. This constraint is the same in the baseline and the policy scenario.\nCPAT includes the ability to set the proportion of fossil-fueled generation that is covered by PPAs and to model the reform of those PPAs by subjecting them to market costs (including carbon pricing).\nCPAT can choose which generation types are investible or not. The user has four options: ‘yes’ (i.e. invests according to cost), ‘no’ (i.e. does not invest in this technology type), ‘if present’ (i.e. invests if this option is present) and ‘manual’ (i.e. capacity additions are set in manual inputs).\nThus, CPAT allows one to phase out any power generation type (preventing any new investment being made). CPAT also by default allows retirement of coal power driven by carbon pricing and allows the user to set the proportion of coal power subject to such retirement (by default 80%).\nCPAT also has the capacity to adjust the financial characteristics of the power sector (cost of capital, etc.). These settings, both for the baseline and the policy scenario, are set in the power settings part of the dashboard. The user can also set the default costs of capital for each income-level. Those settings are in the ‘Power’ tab.\nCPAT by default has a power sector storage requirement which imposes the marginal system cost of needed storage on new variable renewable energy investment. The storage includes short- and long-term components. The latter component is highly uncertain, and the user is encouraged to check and confirm these settings.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.27: Power Sector Specific Policies\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.9 Other policies\nOther policies are not included in CPAT at this point. These include public investments (e.g., in smart grids or public transportation), low carbon fuel standards, biofuel mandates, building codes, incentives for specific technologies (e.g., geothermal power, nuclear, carbon capture and storage), emission rate policies for non-road vehicles, measures for extractive industries (e.g., moratoria on extraction, charges on production or fugitive emissions), and mitigation instruments beyond the energy sector. Broader policies to promote R&D into critical technologies are also beyond the scope of CPAT.\n\n\n1.3.2.10 Metrics for comparing policies\nThe CPAT Dashboard provides a series of results that can be used to compare policies across different dimensions. The main metrics are described below.\nCO2 emissions. CO2 emissions are given by the consumption of each fossil fuel product, aggregated across sectors, multiplied by the CO2 emissions factor for that fuel product, and then aggregated across different fossil fuel products.\nRevenue. Revenues from carbon mitigation policies are calculated net of indirect changes in revenues (or outlays) from pre-existing energy taxes (or subsidies). Direct revenues from carbon pricing are simply the carbon price times the CO2 emissions to which they are applied and, in the case of ETSs, the fraction of allowances that are auctioned (rather than freely allocated). Revenues from pre-existing energy taxes are the product of the prior fuel tax rate (which is negative in the case of fuel subsidies) and the fuel consumption to which they are applied, aggregated across fuels and sectors, plus the product of any electricity tax and the electricity consumption to which it applies. Indirect revenue losses from carbon pricing are the difference between revenues from pre-existing energy taxes before and after carbon pricing. Similarly, revenues from new, or increases in existing, energy taxes are the tax increase times the fuel or electricity to which the increase applies, net of indirect revenue changes from pre-existing energy taxes.\nFor regulations and revenue-neutral feebates there is no direct revenue, though there is generally an indirect revenue loss as these policies erode bases for pre-existing energy taxes. For renewable and clean technology subsidies, there is a direct revenue loss equal to the product of the subsidy rate and the base to which it applies plus indirect revenue losses from pre-existing energy taxes.\nExternalities. CPAT estimates externalities due to improved human health (because of reduction in air pollution), reduced road accidents, reduced travel time and reduced road maintenance costs. Please refer to the Air Pollution and Transport chapters for more information on the externalities calculation.\nDistributional effects. CPAT also offers an incidence analysis about the consumption effects that household could experience after a carbon pricing policy. The details can be consulted in the Distribution chapter.\nGDP Effects. GDP growth will be affected by carbon pricing and the total impact will depend on how the revenues are used and other assumptions and parameters used in CPAT. Please refer to the Output section for details.\nClimate benefits. The climate benefits are linked to the GHG emission reductions that can be achieved with a policy and the social cost of carbon. For details on emissions calculations and the social cost of carbon in CPAT, please refer to Chapter 3 on the Mitigation Methodology.\nUsing the previous metrics, the Section Monetized welfare benefits discusses the estimation of the monetized domestic environmental costs from fuel use. The domestic environmental co-benefits of mitigation policies are calculated by the induced reductions in use of a fuel product in a particular sector, multiplied by the corresponding domestic environmental cost per unit, and aggregated across sectors and fuels. Efficiency costs of policies reflect losses in producer and consumer surplus in fossil fuel markets, which in turn correspond to areas under marginal abatement cost schedules – they can be interpreted as the annualized costs of using cleaner, but costlier technologies, and of reducing energy consumption below levels households would otherwise prefer. Efficiency costs are calculated using applications and extensions of long-established formulas in the public finance literature (e.g., Harberger, 1964) based on second-order approximations. These formulas can be applied with data on the size of tax distortions in fuel and electricity markets, any induced quantity changes in markets affected by these distortions (an output from the model), and any new source of price distortion created by carbon policies.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.28: Monetized Welfare Benefits in CPAT Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.11 Headline projected effects panel\nThe main outputs are shown under Headline projected effects, in Panel B in CPAT Dashboard. Starting from the left, these graphs show:\n\nGHG emissions relative to baseline (dashed line) & NDC target (dotted horizontal line);\nFiscal revenues (before recycling of funds);\nImpact on projected GDP growth;\nImpacts on households (note: only countries for which household data are available);\nCo-benefits: Averted air pollution & road accident deaths; and\nTotal monetized benefits from the policy.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.29: Main outputs, Dashboard tab\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.12 Advanced settings\nAdvanced settings can be defined throughout the Dashboard, related to the different CPAT modules. The settings are displayed by clicking the + button to expand.\nFor instance, for the Mitigation module, the first panel of advanced settings is around row 16 and includes key policy options, sources for key inputs, uncertainty adjustments and miscellaneous effects.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.30: General settings\n\n\nThe mitigation module also has wide range of advanced options which are covered around row 58. For example, the user has an option to specify existing ETS permit price growth for future years, can choose to apply the same VAT tax rate in the residential and transport sectors if it is different from the general VAT in the economy, adjust social cost of carbon tax and more.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.31: Advanced Mitigation Options\n\n\nThe dashboard includes advanced parameter options for the power models around row 109. This includes, for example, information on the proportion of fossil-fueled generation that is covered by power purchase agreements (PPAs), an important measure of how inflexible the power sector is to prices due to market structure factors. To access this panel, click the plus sign to ungroup.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.32: Power model settings\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.13 Mitigation module: Advanced settings and detailed results\nThe mitigation module panels show the following results:\n\nEnergy baseline externalities, prices, consumption, and targets;\nPower sector results;\nFiscal, macroeconomic, and welfare effects;\nGHG emissions and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs); and\nEnergy-related CO2 emissions by fuel & sector (power, industries and transport).\n\nThe baseline externalities, prices, consumption and targets panel contain information about estimated externalities, energy price changes induced by the policy, and projected and efficient price change. One can select the ‘year of interest’ in the top right of the panel. The lower row shows sectoral and fuel energy consumption changes (the baseline is with the dotted line), changes induced by the policy and national sectoral NDC targets.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.33: Prices Panel\n\n\nThe CPAT power panel contains information about the electricity system. The graphs are shown below. One can select the ‘year of interest’ in the top right of the panel. CPAT has two power models: the elasticity-based and technoeconomic (engineer) models, with the default set to the average between the two. However, the more CPAT can be tailored by the user to country-specific settings, the more the user is encouraged to use the ‘engineer’ choice (this is selectable on cell L24 in the original ‘more detailed options’ panel).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.34: Power model settings\n\n\nThe fiscal effects contain notably the multipliers used in CPAT (bottom left) - the default is MFmod multipliers. The bottom middle shows the net GDP effects in time.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.35: Fiscal, macroeconomic and welfare effects\n\n\nThe emissions panel shows a deep dive into GHG emissions.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.36: GHG and short-lived climate pollutants panel\n\n\nThe energy related emissions show a deep dive into CO2 and other energy-related emissions including the Kaya identity which disaggregates the drivers of emissions changes.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.37: Energy-related emissions\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.14 Distributional consumption effects on households\nFor distributional results, first, check if household data for your country is already included; if yes, define how to transfer revenues (dropdown in ‘Policy options’); adjust accordingly if red flags appear. If ‘No’ adjustment for behavioral/structural change is selected, the price increases are fully passed on to the consumer which may overestimate consumption effects (i.e. tax-induced mitigation effect is not considered). Alternatively, choose to factor in decile-specific price-driven demand adjustments/elasticities.\nChoose representation of means or medians: while median effects are more representative, some fuels may not be shown if &gt;50% of households report zero or missing expenses (e.g., if poor data quality). Make an informed choice on mean/median representation and modelling results with/out taking into account reduced prices due to behavior adjustments.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.38: Distributional settings\n\n\nFor more information, please see the distribution chapter of CPAT documentation.\n\n\n1.3.2.15 Air pollution (and associated health effects) results\nThe recommended default option to estimate concentration changes is “Avg. iF and LS FASST*” or “Local study-FASST”. See the air pollution methodology chapter for more details on what the different options entail. Is important to check the sectors’ contribution to ambient PM2.5 and adjust modeling approach if needed.\nAs in the other sections of CPAT, the cells in yellow can be modified by the user. For instance, the user can input a local Value of the Statistical Life to value air pollution externalities from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.39: Air Pollution settings in CPAT Dashboard\n\n\nSome additional parameters can be modified in the “Manual inputs” tab. A link to this tab is at the end of the air pollution settings in the Dashboard. In that tab, the user can input source apportionment information, that reflects the sectoral contribution to ambient PM2.5 in the analyzed country. Notice that for CPAT to use that manual input, the “Emissions to concentrations, PM2.5” parameter needs to be set to “Manual-FASST”.\nFor more information, please see the air pollution chapter from CPAT documentation.\n\n\n1.3.2.16 Transport co-benefits (road accidents, congestion, and road damage)\nThe group of panels shows the results for transport co-benefits. This includes results for distance traveled, fatalities on the road, congestion, fuel prices and the statistical relationship between fuel prices, accidents and congestion.\nFor more information, please see the transport chapter of this documentation.\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Manual inputs tab: Tailoring CPAT\nCPAT is designed to be able to be run ‘off the shelf’. Nevertheless, the default settings will usually need to be checked and tested for the country context. In particular:\n\nThe prices and subsidy information should be checked and, if needed, augmented on the manual settings tab.\nThe user can set the investment trajectory in the power sector, both in the baseline and the policy scenarios. For more information, please see the CPAT quick-start guide.\n\nMost of these tailored inputs are stored in the manual inputs tab. This tab also gives the option to add any combination of additional fuel- and sector-specific taxes (excise reform section).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.40: Manual Inputs tab\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Navigating other CPAT tabs\nEach module is divided into sections (dark green) and subsections (light green). As mentioned earlier, subsections can be ‘grouped’ so only one line of results are shown, or ‘ungrouped’ so that all calculations are shown. To group, click the small ‘1’ at the top left of the main window. To ungroup one subsection, click the small + sign on the left-hand side. Note that in CPAT, codes have the following format:\nCountry.Tab.Variable.Sector.FuelType.Other.SubscenarioNumber4\nUsers may wish occasionally to change the coding of CPAT itself. In this case it is noted that CPAT is designed in such a way that the whole of part C (the baseline scenario) can be copy-pasted into part D (the policy scenario) or vice versa. It however important not to copy the first, dark green row of part C (D) which designates the baseline (the policy implemented). Note also that due to computational limitations, for the Mitigation module, part C should be copy-pasted into part D, subsection by subsection, rather than all at one time. More information on coding or modifying CPAT is available on request.\nTo ensure CPAT is copy-pastable, three principles must be covered:\n\nThere should be no references between C and D\nReferences to other sections than C and D or to other tabs must be row-absolute (e.g. ’MTInputs!$F$212’)\nReferences within a submodule (C) to other parts of C must be row-relative (without a $ before the row number – e.g. ‘MTInputs!F$212’)\nReferences in the results are referring to C and D must use an ‘Index-match’ based on the CPAT code. This means that the user should:\n\nDefine a helper row (or column if needed) number, using the MATCH function in Excel based on the CPAT code.\nUse the INDEX function in Excel.\n\n\n\n1.3.4.1 The Mitigation tab\nThe following figure shows the organization of the mitigation module.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.41: Mitigation module: Overview\n\n\nThe mitigation module is divided into several sub-sections:\n\nPart A: Overview.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.42: Mitigation module: Overview\n\n\n\nPart B: Key Assumptions and inputs. This section comprises assumptions used and data inputs (i.e. macro data, elasticities, energy consumption, domestic and international prices, etc.)\nParts C and D: The main model repeated twice (baseline and policy – usually a carbon tax). In particular, part C holds for the baseline scenario and part D for the policy scenario. These parts are identical, except that part D accounts for the policy implemented. These sections build the two power models (based on prices inputs) and calculates the energy use across the main sectors (i.e. industry, building, transport, and other energy use), as well as the associated emissions. The sections also provide estimates on the fiscal revenues resulting from the policy in place and associated GDP effects.\nParts E and F: The results areas. Finally, parts E and F summarize all the results to create the graphic visualization. This area cannot be ‘grouped’ as then otherwise parts of graphs that rely on these data would not be visible.\n\n\n\n1.3.4.2 The Distribution tab\nThe organization of the Distribution module is shown in Figure 1.43.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.43: Distribution module organization\n\n\nThe Distributional effects module is divided into the following sections:\n\nA: Module overview:\n\nA.I. Description. This sub-section provides a brief flow chart-style outline of the Distribution module (see Figure 1.44):\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.44: Distribution module description\n\n\n\nA.II. Country coverage. This sub-section lists the WB member countries, for which analytical outputs are available in the CPAT Distribution module.\nB: Key Assumptions and inputs. This section includes: 1) module assumptions, e.g., years of reference, macro variables, scaling factors for calibration to national accounts data, etc. (sub-section B.I); 2) sector- and energy product-specific percent price changes from the Mitigation module used in the analysis (sub-sections B.II and B.III); and 3) cost/price pass-through coefficients (sub-section B.IV.).\nC: Climate policy scenario (e.g., Carbon tax). This section includes the distributional effects (consumption incidence) analysis and related calculations. Specifically, it is divided into: 1) calculations of the definitive energy and non-energy price changes used in the analysis (sub-section C.I); 2) various adjustments to the incidence effects analysis, based on user inputs (e.g., decile/product-specific price elasticities of demand, behavioral and structural change adjustment, etc.) (sub-section C.II); 3) household budget shares for fuel (sub-section C.III) and non-fuel (sub-section C.IV) consumption; 4) incidence effects from fuel (sub-section C.V), non-fuel (sub-section C.VI) and total (sub-section C.VII) consumption; 5) calibration of data to national accounts (sub-section C.VIII); 6) effects on inequality (sub-section C.IX);\n\ncompensation schemes via transfers (sub-section C.X); and 8) compensation schemes via personal income tax (PIT) reductions (sub-section C.XI).\n\nD: Outputs for charts. This section extracts results for the various charts available in the Dashboard. It comprises of: 1) various chart labels (sub-section D.I); 2) vertical (between-decile) consumption incidence results expressed in “relative terms”/percent of household consumption (sub-section D.II); 3) vertical (between-decile) incidence results expressed in “absolute terms”/local currency units (LCU) (sub-section D.III); 4) horizontal (within-decile) incidence results expressed in “relative terms”/percent of household consumption (sub-section D.IV); 5) percent of climate policy revenues needed to fully compensate given deciles (sub-section D.V); and 6) percent increases in industry/firm costs by sector (sub-section D.VI). This area should remain ‘ungrouped’ (or otherwise unhidden), to allow for visualization of the relevant charts in the Dashboard.\n\n\n\n1.3.4.3 The Air pollution tab\nThe Air pollution module is divided into several sub-sections, as presented in Figure 1.45.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Sections A and B in the Air pollution tab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Sections C and D in the Air pollution tab\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.45: Overview of the Air Pollution tab in CPAT\n\n\n\nPart A: Description or Overview. The first part of the module contains an overview of the contents in the tab. This tab receives as input energy consumption and emissions from the Mitigation module. Using those inputs (among other inputs), this module produces ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter and ozone, health impacts and economic impacts of pollution.\nPart B: Key assumptions and inputs. This section contains all the calibration options available for the air pollution module, inputs from the Mitigation module, and other inputs required for calculations. In general, in this section are included calculations that will feed both the baseline and carbon tax calculations, such as the health effects relative risk functions, baseline incidence rates, value of the statistical life, among others (see Figure 1.45 (a)).\nPart C: Baseline. This section contains all the calculations for the baseline scenario, including ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and O3, relative risks, population exposed to pollution, the attributable burden of pollution (mortality and morbidity) and working days lost due to pollution.\nPart D: Carbon price policy. This section contains all the calculations for the policy scenario selected in the Dashboard tab. Sections D and C have the exact same calculations. As in the Mitigation tab, section C can be copy-pasted into section C.\nPart E: Results for other modules. The Road Transport module in CPAT uses some of the calculations made in the Air pollution module, such as daily earning from workers, the value of the Statistical life and population above 15 years old. Those variables are in this section.\nPart F: Results for charts. In this section are located some additional calculations regarding the difference between metrics in the baseline and in the carbon price scenarios. All the graphs included in the Dashboard, related to the Air pollution module, are feed by data from this section.\nPart G: Equations and notes. This section includes some of the equations used inside the air pollution module. They are numbered and when they are used inside the module, they are referenced using the equation number.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.46: Part G, Air Pollution module in CPAT\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4.4 The Transport tab\nThe Transport tab includes the road transport modelling for CPAT. The module is divided into several sub-sections, following a similar structure than the other CPAT modules, as presented in Figure 1.47.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.47: Overview of the Transport tab in CPAT\n\n\n\nPart A: Description. The first part of the module contains an overview of the contents in the tab. This tab receives as input the changes in fuel prices from the Mitigation module. Using those inputs (among other inputs), this module produces the number of fatalities from road accidents, additional travel time due to congestion and road damages.\nPart B: Key assumptions and inputs. This section contains all the calibration options available for the Road Transport module, country characteristics and elasticities.\nPart C: Baseline. This section contains all the calculations for the baseline scenario (accidents, travel time, road damage, among others) and fuel prices for the baseline, from the Mitigation tab.\nPart D: Carbon price policy. This section contains all the calculations for the policy scenario (accidents, travel time, road damage, among others) and fuel prices for the policy scenario, from the Mitigation tab. Sections D and C have the exact same calculations. As in the Mitigation tab, section C can be copy-pasted into section C.\nPart E: Results for other modules. In this section are results from the Road Transport module that will be used in other modules. For instance, the welfare metrics calculated in the Mitigation module are using the transport externalities from this section.\nPart F: Results for charts. In this section are located some additional calculations regarding the difference between metrics in the baseline and in the carbon price scenarios. All the graphs included in the Dashboard related to the Road Transport module using the metrics in this section.\n\n\n\n1.3.4.5 Data sources tab\nCPAT data sources and terms and conditions are shown here in the Data sources tab.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.48: CPAT datasources and T&Cs\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4.6 MTInputs tab\nThis tab contains the assumptions and parameters that are used in the calculations in CPAT. This means that the configuration observed in the Dashboard (explained in this document) is not directly used in the calculations. Rather, the settings from this tab, MTInputs, are used depending on the CPAT running mode. CPAT can be run in three different modes:\n\nIt can be run ‘from the dashboard’ with user selected settings.\nIt can be run using fully default settings. To change this, please see element 4 in the main policy input area and select ‘Defaults’.\nIt can be run in multi-country, multi-policy mode. To select this, use the ‘Multiscenario Tool’, described in section 1.3.5, which is a separate spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.49: Set Default Settings\n\n\nAll of these three sets of parameters ‘flow through’ MTinputs tab, which shows the comprehensive parameter set used for calculation in CPAT.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.50: MTInputs: Comprehensive Parameter Inputs\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4.7 MTOutputs tab\nAs it was explained in the previous section, CPAT can be run in a “multi-country, multi-policy” mode. When this is the case, the tab MTOutputs stores the results that will be exported to the Multiscenario Tool, described in the following section. This tab contains a series of indicators, reflecting the main results from each CPAT module. A view of this tab is presented in the next figure.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.51: MTOutputs: Code-readable Output tab\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 The Multiscenario Tool (MT)\nCPAT run in standalone mode relates to a single country with two scenarios: the baseline and a policy scenario. CPAT can also be run in multiscenario mode, meaning for many countries and/or many scenarios. More information about the multiscenario tool is available on request.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.52: The Multiscenario Tool"

    "text": "2.1 Background and introduction\nEnding poverty while managing climate change are defining challenges of this century. In recent years, these twin objectives have become enmeshed normatively and enshrined institutionally. In the last three years, 193 countries committed to achieving 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—from tackling poverty, hunger, and gender disparities to improving health, energy access, and education. In addition, 195 countries committed in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Notably, over 130 developing countries committed to national emissions abatement (through Nationally Determined Contributions, NDCs), for the first time. As a result, these countries need policy instruments to help them achieve their SDGs and NDCs.\nEnvironmental tax reform (ETR) has been proposed as one of the important parts of our toolbox to do so. ETR can help developing countries reap substantial benefits, far beyond those of climate action.\nMore than two decades of research in development and environmental economics suggests that the welfare of ETR effects are likely to be more positive in developing countries than is commonly understood. Development co-benefits, such as direct improvements in human health or reductions in congestion and accidents, can be very large in developing countries, where air pollution kills millions and congestion reduces the benefits from agglomeration externalities and urbanization. ETR can also help finance ministries raise much-needed domestic funds at lower cost than some conventional sources of public revenues. These revenue gains can help expanding public expenditure, building health care and social protection systems, as well as investing to achieve universal access to infrastructure services such as modern energy, water and sanitation, mobility and access to information and communication. Because ETR can be simple to design and implement, low administrative capacity and political support need not hinder reform efforts.\nIn short, ETR can be the fiscal foundation upon which developing countries achieve both the SDGs and their NDCs. With the COVID-19 crisis, it is widely accepted that economic stimulus and restoring sound public finances are both needed, and that the recovery process can be designed to contribute to sustainable development. In particular, countries with financing constraints may want to consider energy subsidy reforms or even explicit carbon pricing to finance urgent needs in health, social sectors or growth-enhancing tax shifts. In the second phase of the recovery, when fiscal consolidation will become pressing, further discussion on the potential of energy taxes is essential. In this context, finance ministries can use CPAT to evaluate such reforms. Another key function of the tool is to help mainstream carbon pricing into WB/IMF country work. CPAT is thus aimed at economists in the World Bank and the IMF as well as finance ministries (via the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action) and planning & line ministries.\nThe Climate Policy Assessment Tool (CPAT) is a spreadsheet-based tool to support these efforts. It allows for rapid estimation of effects of carbon pricing and fossil fuel subsidy reforms along several economic and non-economic dimensions. These include key macroeconomic variables, energy consumption, local and global pollutants, ‘development co-benefits’, distribution/equity and poverty. Its objectives are to:\n\nHelp decision-makers and analysts do quick diagnostics on the potential benefits from explicit carbon pricing and fossil fuel subsidy reforms to inform SCDs and other country strategies;\nProvide first estimates of benefits across different dimensions (from tax revenues to health) to start an engagement with country counterpart and identify areas where more in-depth analyses are needed or promising.\n\nFor instance, CPAT is used for the EFI EU Regular Economic Report, which informs the EU’s consideration of environmental fiscal reforms; Mexico’s Public Finance Review, which examines its carbon tax; reviews of health-related tax reform option for Brazil and China (with Health GP); Ivory Coast’s PMR program; CGE and macrostructural models for Pakistan, Italy, Vietnam (within the MTI macro-modelling team); and for TA to Northern Macedonia’s on environmental tax reform review (ETR). CPAT can contribute to various reports products within the WB (SCDs, CPFs, DPOs, CEMs, State & Trends). CPAT has e.g. formed the analytical basis for a Bank-Fund report to the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action on carbon pricing.\nCPAT is being developed jointly by the World Bank and IMF. It evolved from an earlier IMF tool, described in Appendix III of a 2019 Board Paper “Fiscal Policies for Paris Climate Strategies” and further applied in the IMF’s October 2019 Fiscal Monitor on “How to Mitigate Climate Change”. Background research for the various channels modeled has been completed by the CPAT team, notably through the studies “Benefits beyond Climate” and “Getting Energy Prices Right”."

The tool produces a series of assessment and visualization of the impact of the policy scenarios on several dimensions including:\n\nmitigation and energy efficiency (i.e., the reduction in GHG emissions, changes in energy consumption);\nmacroeconomic and fiscal aggregates (GDP, tax revenues);\nair pollution and health (concentration, but also mortality and morbidity);\ntransport (road fatalities and congestion);\ndistributional impacts (per consumption decile, but also by (urban/rural) sub-sample, and industrial cost changes)\n\nA schematic view of the tool is provided in Figure 2.1, and a screenshot of the dashboard is provided in Figure 2.2. It is expected that the tool is used to explore various policy options, either in an interactive way, or to create country-specific document.\nThe tool is calibrated on 150 countries, but the user is advised to remain cognizant of data issues, which can affect the quality of the assessment. The Distribution module is more limited, as it depends on the specific treatment of household surveys.

    "text": "2.3 CPAT structure and methodology\nThis section provides a summary of the methodology (or methodologies) used by each of the modules, as well as basic comparison with state-of-the-art models. The value of CPAT is to be consistent with these state-of-the-art models in each dimension, and to provide in one place all these dimensions together to facilitate analysis and comparisons and help teams prepare country diagnostics. For the interested reader, in-depth methodological notes are available for each module (CPAT chapters documentation here).\n\n2.3.1 Mitigation module\nThe mitigation module is a simplified reduced-form model of fuel consumption, deriving quantities under a baseline and a policy scenario broadly in line with more complex models (the IEA’s World Energy Model, Enerdata POLES). The mitigation module’s primary goal is to predict energy use, energy prices, emissions, carbon tax revenues, and GDP effects over the time horizon of CPAT (2019-2035). More details are available below in the methodological notes.\nThe module takes four types of inputs: (1) energy balances and price inputs; (2) external forecasts (baseline international energy prices and macro indicators); (3) parameter inputs (elasticities, fiscal multipliers); (4) user-specified policy inputs (for example, the level and coverage of a carbon tax, exemptions phase-out and other inputs).\nThe module’s outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector, greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 and other GHG such as leaked methane), fiscal revenues and GDP effects, price changes, power generation, and power sector investment.\nThe mitigation module forms the core of CPAT: when the user chooses a policy in the dashboard, the mitigation module works out the direct impact of the policy, displays it in the dashboard, and passes the outputs on to other modules (see Figure 2.1).\nThe general approach to determining baseline fuel consumption and the response to a carbon tax or other policy is a simplified, reduced-form model based on income and price elasticities. The changes in energy consumption from the base year are driven by energy prices (including the influence of mitigation policy) and real (total) GDP. Real GDP adjusts to changes in fiscal policy through multiplier effects. It can be considered the main driver of the baseline, while energy prices are the primary driver of any policy, such as a carbon tax. Exogenous changes to efficiency and the price of renewable energy are also drivers of fuel use and consumption.\nFor data and parameter sources, see the mitigation chapter. For example, elasticities with regard to prices and income are derived from Burke and Csereklyei (2016) using the relationship from Gertler et al. (2016)\nThe mitigation module includes two power sector models, an ‘elasticity-based’ model and a hybrid techno-economic dynamic model (‘engineer model’) of the power sector with explicit capital stock. The two models use the same power demand elasticities and separately consider power generation’s costs by type. The user can either select ‘average’ – meaning an average of both models – or tailor the model using the engineer model alone\nThe ‘elasticity-based’ model uses marginal increases in fuel prices and price elasticities to determine the shares of each generation type. It is simple, transparently parameterized, easily explainable, and easily deployable in an Excel spreadsheet model used in previous versions of CPAT and IMF tools.\nThe techno-economic ‘engineer’ model explicitly models the capacity of different generation types, with capacity1 expanding to meet desired power demand. Flexible capacity (gas and coal) is allocated according to marginal price, with a sigmoidal function of relative price. Investment is also a function of levelized cost, with a system penalty for the cost of integrating high levels of renewable penetration. Transmission losses are modeled as a fixed quantity of total generation.\nThe main advantage of the engineer model’ is that it allows modeling decisions changing the stock of assets in the power sector (investment and retirement) and decisions changing the use of assets for power generation (dispatch). In addition, the model allows the user to define a Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) scale up rate. The rates reflect a ‘linear’ type constraint. It constrains generation in VRE additions to be a certain percentage of total generation (in gross additions, not net of retirements). The model is consistent with countries’ generation capacities and makes it possible to investigate the radically different power systems consistent with high carbon prices, while the empirical ‘elasticity-based’ model is valid only for more marginal changes.\nFinally, as one of the main outputs, the mitigation module estimates carbon pricing effects on GDP. CPAT adjusts the baseline GDP growth forecasts endogenously depending on different carbon pricing and revenue recycling scenarios. The module captures two channels: the fiscal effects and the impact on consumption. In the first channel, a carbon tax has both direct and indirect effects on GDP. The latter arises when the carbon tax revenues are recycled as a reduction of other taxes and/or increased government spending. We quantify these effects using the CPAT fiscal multipliers estimates. In the second channel, the change in GDP affects energy consumption and, therefore, the effective carbon tax revenues. This channel is captured by the income elasticities of energy demand.\nCPAT uses four sources of fiscal multipliers: “Income-group” multipliers and “global” averages are obtained from the World Bank’s Macro-Fiscal Model (MFMod). “Estimated” multipliers are obtained econometrically from panels of high- and low-income countries created along the dimensions of income levels, regions, debt levels and trade openness. Country-specific multipliers are then obtained as weighted averages over the respective multipliers from each sample/subsample which the country is part of. Finally, since multipliers tend to be higher during expansions and lower during contractions, all baseline multipliers can be adjusted upwards and downwards by adding/subtracting one empirical standard deviation. This takes into account the uncertainty around empirical estimates and gives the CPAT user additional flexibility in choosing the appropriate set of multipliers. Finally, the user has the option to “manually” enter the preferred multipliers, thereby allowing for a thorough exploration of the uncertainty in these parameters.\nA full summary for reviewers including a list of change and full information about the validation of the mitigation module against ex post studies and other models, is available in the mitigation chapter of this report. See section 3.9.\n\n\n2.3.2 Air Pollution module\nPolicies aimed to reduce GHG emissions, such as carbon pricing, can lead to a reduction in ambient air pollution due to the co-emission of GHGs and local pollutants when burning fossil fuels. Local pollutants, such as BC, OC, NH3, SO2 and NMVOC are responsible for the formation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) pollution. These pollutants contributed to 6.67 million deaths and 213 million DALYs in 2019 (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation). Air quality improvements will reduce mortality and morbidity and CPAT quantifies those effects as a co-benefits of carbon pricing.\nThe air pollution module is mostly based on models developed by external institutions and researchers, but also includes modeling developed specifically for CPAT. The main inputs are: (1) energy consumption in time and scenario by fuel type and sector from the Mitigation module; (2) emissions factors net of projected average use of pollution control equipment, fuel processing and combustion method from GAINS model[^02_summary-4]; (3) concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone for the baseline year (2019); (4) emissions-to-concentrations relationships for ambient PM2.5 and ozone, based on source receptor matrices (TM5-FASST), regression analysis, source apportionment studies, intake fractions and machine learning models, (5) relative risk functions for exposure to PM2.5 and O3; and (7) population projections in time. Details are available in the air pollution methodological note. Wagner et al. (2020)\nThe main results from the air pollution module are mortality and disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributed to air pollution (ambient and household) under the baseline and the carbon price scenario. Other outputs include the economic valuation of averted deaths (using a transferred value of the statistical life), health expenditure, working days lost due to pollution and market output losses due to morbidity and mortality.\nReduced-form approximations are used to estimate emissions, concentration of pollutants and health effects. We use and adapt the results of more complex models into simplified relationships. For instance, in the case of the relationship between emissions of pollutants and ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone, CPAT includes the option to use the results from a linear emulator of a complex global chemical transport model. The results of the air pollution module are in line with other more complex models (see Figure 2.4 (a) and Figure 2.4 (b)), although both CPAT and the models to which we compare to are subject to uncertainty and the results may be sensitive to the assumptions used. We address this issue in CPAT by allowing the user to input local information, if available, and to switch among methodological options (with the best options possibly dependent on the country chosen).\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: CPAT estimation of ambient air pollution death rates versus GBD2019 estimates\n\n\nSource: CPAT results and GBD 2019 Risk Factors Collaborators.

With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to sharp increases in inequality and poverty, distributional concerns have become more relevant to decision-makers. In the realm of environmental fiscal reforms, equity and poverty considerations receive even more political attention than in the context of ‘traditional’ fiscal reforms. Public acceptability is strongly driven by the reforms’ perceived fairness and impact on low-income households.\nThe Distribution Module of CPAT 1.0 aims to inform the spread of the immediate fiscal incidence across (vertical distribution) and within (horizontal distribution; see Figure 2.7) income groups, focusing on consumption effects and compensatory schemes. Tax-induced consumer price changes and revenue recycling in the form of direct transfers have been at the center of the literature on fiscal redistribution, since such salient, short-term effects are arguably the most relevant from a political economy perspective.3 More details are available in the Distribution methodological note (with detailed country coverage).\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Net distributional effect with cash transfer: Horizontal distribution of relative consumption effects (% consumption for $50 Carbon tax per tCO2e in 2022), China\n\n\nThe Distribution Module allows the user to estimate the carbon tax incidence on consumption, taking into account the direct effect from the use of fuels, as well as the indirect effect from the consumption of other, non-fuel/-energy goods and services. We follow the standard approach in the literature, combining household budget survey (HBS) information with input-output (IO) data, adjusted such that they yield the same effective carbon price revenues as the ones produced by the Mitigation Module. Country-fuel-sector- price increases are based on scenario-specific estimates from CPAT’s Mitigation Module. Further, the user is provided with two options to relax the typical IO assumptions of full cost-push impacts and absence of behavioral adjustments. Additionally, there is one option to rebate the price increases of a country’s primary cooking fossil fuel to selected bottom deciles to help prevent them from switching to biomass.\nFour modes of direct and indirect transfer schemes can be simulated, once the user inputs the share of revenues allocated under each scheme type: i) new or existing targeted transfers (for which the user can decide the targeted percentiles, among other features); ii) transfers towards public investment in infrastructure access; and iii) scaling up an existing social protection scheme (following the targeting of the initial scheme), and iv) reforming countries’ personal income tax (PIT) schemes. The revenue amounts available for redistribution are based on scenario-specific estimates from the Mitigation Module. New or existing targeted transfers are universal among the targeted percentiles, while infrastructure transfers are targeted to those households without initial access to clean water, affordable electricity, clean sanitation, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), or public transport, based on HBS microdata. Revenue recycling that increases current public spending is proportional to the existing social protection schemes, such as social assistance, insurance, or in-kind benefit schemes. Further to the above, transfer scheme targeting is also available for decile-specific population shares that are below international poverty lines (incomes of 1.9 or 3.2 2011 PPP USD/day) via “poverty-conditional cash transfers”.\nBoth negative consumption effects as well as positive compensation scheme effects are expressed as shares of pre-reform consumption and in absolute, per-capita monetary terms on a decile level, separately for the rural, urban and overall (or national) populations.4 For vertical distribution graphs, the user can further choose between decile mean and median consumption data inputs. Horizontal distribution between the 25th and 75th percentile of consumption data inputs within each decile is available for consumption effects (both absent as well as net of compensation schemes).\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Relative mean consumption effect (% consumption for $35 Carbon tax per tCO2e in 2022), Cote d’Ivoire\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Relative mean consumption effect, urban vs. rural (% consumption for $35 Carbon tax per tCo2e in 2022), Cote d’Ivoire\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Road Transport module\nCarbon pricing impacts fuel prices and shapes driving behavior and can thereby contribute to internalizing externalities from driving. Increases in fuel prices predictably lead to reductions in vehicle-miles traveled (VMT). This may be a result of people transitioning to other transport modes, e.g. public/collective transport options, choice of residence and workplace location or behavioral changes including car-pooling, trip frequencies and driving behavior (aggressive vs. fuel-efficient acceleration). As road traffic has many externalities aside carbon emissions, the reduction in VMT also leads to a reduction in transport-related externalities such as congestion, accidents and road damage. To estimate the magnitude of these co-benefits, the road transport module quantifies the effect of a user-defined carbon price or road fuel tax on (1) the intensity of congestion as measured by the time lost relative to free-flowing traffic, (2) the number of road fatalities, and (3) the maintenance cost due to road damage.\nThe Road Transport module is based on elasticities that we estimate using an international country-year level dataset. This dataset is compiled from many sources and describes road transport, as well as general demographics and economic variables. The dataset covers the time from 1994 to 2019 and 180 countries, so that we can use within-country and between-country variation for identification. We estimate elasticities with respect to fuel prices and with respect to fuel taxes, as well as short and long-run elasticities. Our country-specific elasticities are based on global coefficients and country-specific covariates.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Input and output of CPAT’s Road Transport module\n\n\nThe magnitude of the resulting elasticities are broadly in line with the literature: for a 10% fuel price increase from a carbon tax, total vehicle-km traveled decrease in the short run on average by 3.5%; congestion levels decrease by 4.5%; accident fatalities decrease by 2.9%; and road damage by decreases by 2.0% in the long run.\nThe estimated elasticities are used within CPAT to produce policy forecasts of total vehicle-km traveled, congestion levels, accident fatalities and road damage cost. By choosing a country and using different parameters for a policy in the dashboard, the user obtains a series of graphs showing the time series with and without the policy, as well as the policy impact given by the difference of the two time series.\n\n\n\n\nBurke, Paul J, and Zsuzsanna Csereklyei. 2016. “Understanding the Energy-GDP Elasticity: A Sectoral Approach.” Energy Economics 58: 199–210.\n\n\nGertler, Paul J, Orie Shelef, Catherine D Wolfram, and Alan Fuchs. 2016. “The Demand for Energy-Using Assets Among the World’s Rising Middle Classes.” American Economic Review 106 (6): 1366–1401.\n\n\nWagner, F, J Borken-Kleefeld, G Kiesewetter, Z Klimont, W Schoepp, and M Amann. 2020. “Implied Emission Factors in the World Bank’s Carbon Pricing Assessment Tool (CPAT).”"

    "text": "3.1 Executive Summary and Reviewer Guide\n\n3.1.1 Introduction\nThe mitigation module lies at the heart of CPAT. It is based on a simplified reduced-form model of fuel consumption, with two alternative power sector models, one of which is a simplified structural technoeconomic power model.\nThe mitigation module’s goal is to predict energy use, energy prices, emissions, carbon tax revenues, economic costs, and GDP effects for a baseline and a policy scenario (carbon pricing, fuel taxes, energy efficiency policies, renewables subsidies, feebates, etc.), over the time horizon of CPAT (2019-2035).\nTo this end, the module is built around different inputs, including (1) energy balances and price inputs; (2) external forecasts (baseline international energy prices and macro indicators); (3) parameter inputs (elasticities, fiscal multipliers, etc.); (4) user-specified policy inputs (for example, the level and coverage of a carbon tax, exemptions and exemption phase-outs, and other inputs).\nThese inputs inform the calculation steps in which: (1) sectoral energy prices, including the effect of pricing policy, are determined; (2) fuel use in the buildings, transport, and industry are estimated; and (3) electricity production costs are calculated to feed the two power models, which then determine generation, investment, etc.\nThe module’s outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector, greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 and other GHG such as methane), fiscal revenues and GDP effects, price changes, power generation, and power sector investment. The structure of the rest of this document is as follows:\n\nOverview\n\nIntroduction\nSummary of Mitigation Module\nNiche and Use Case\nCritical Policy Modelling Choices\nData\nTesting and Validation\nStatus of Upgrades since last time\nCaveats\nNotation\n\nPrices and taxes;\nEnergy consumption (excluding power supply);\nPower supply prices and models;\nEmissions of CO2 and other GHG;\nFiscal Revenues;\nMonetized welfare estimates;\nValidation: including regression, comparison with other models, and hindcasting.\nAppendices including:\n\nAppendix A - Macro data of CPAT: Sources and codes;\nAppendix B - Energy balances;\nAppendix C - Prices and taxes methodology;\nAppendix D - Examples of NDC calculations;\nAppendix E - Parameter options in the mitigation module;\nAppendix F – Notation in CPAT; and\nAppendix G – Data sources.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Summary of Methodology\nThe mitigation module is a simplified reduced-form model of fuel consumption, deriving quantities under a baseline and a policy scenario broadly in line with more complex models (the IEA’s World Energy Model, Enerdata POLES – see 3.8.3 Model comparisons). The mitigation module’s goal is to predict energy use, energy prices, emissions, carbon tax revenues, economic costs, domestic environmental co-benefits, and GDP effects over the time horizon of CPAT (2018-2035) for a wide range of mitigation instruments (carbon pricing, fuel taxes, energy efficiency policies, renewables subsidies, feebates, etc.). The main drivers of the emissions projections are GDP growth (including GDP-per-capita and population), income elasticities, and rates of technological change. Fuel use responses to policies are driven principally by proportional changes in fuel prices caused by projected market dynamics and government policies (including carbon prices).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Overview of the mitigation module\n\n\nThe mitigation module relies on several inputs and provides numerous outputs. The module is at the core of CPAT, as its results feed into other modules.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Overview of the mitigation module’s inputs and outputs\n\n\nThe general approach to determining baseline fuel consumption and the response to a carbon tax or other policy is a simplified, reduced-form model based on income and price elasticities.5 The changes in energy consumption from the base year are driven by energy prices (including the influence of mitigation policy) and real (total) GDP. Real GDP (which is the primary driver of the baseline) adjusts to changes in fiscal policy through multiplier effects (see the Chapter on Multipliers). Exogenous changes to efficiency and the price of renewable energy are also drivers of fuel use and composition.\nThe mitigation module comprises two power sector models and simple models for industry, transport, and buildings. The two power models, the ‘elasticity-based’ model and the hybrid techno-economic dynamic model (‘engineer model’) of the power sector with explicit capital stock use identical power demand elasticities and separately consider power generation’s costs by type. For ‘off-the-shelf’ usage of CPAT, we recommend an average of the two models. For more tailored work, we recommend using the engineer model.\nThe elasticity-based model requires only minor tailoring and checking. As a result, it makes no distinction between short-term and long-term behavior. It also fails to distinguish between dispatchable and non-dispatchable generation types. The engineer power model fills this gap by separating investments, retirement, and dispatch decisions. It includes countries’ generation capacities and makes it possible to investigate the radically different power systems compatible with high carbon prices. However, the model still cannot account for inflexibility, off-price policies, and local price variation (e.g., coal). Due to the constraints of Excel, it can only approximate the temporal match between electricity supply and demand.\nThe module’s outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector (i.e., buildings, transport, and industry). They are estimated based on a fundamental model structure described in an IMF paper.[^03_mitigation-6] Energy use responds to energy prices and real GDP. Additional outputs include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., CO2 and other GHG emissions such as leakage methane which represents small amounts of GHG gases), fiscal revenues and GDP effects, economic efficiency costs, price changes, power generation, and power sector investment.\nTo ensure that the model is correctly fitted, specific calibrations are undertaken for the observed years, i.e., 2019, 2020, and 2021 (and beyond if necessary and if data are available). In particular, due to the unprecedented global economic shock induced by Covid-19 and Ukraine invasion, energy prices may have behaved in an “anomalous” way, leading the model results to deviate from the observed data. This calibration ensures a proper starting trajectory for the model.\nThe rest of this section is intended to help reviewers navigate the Mitigation documentation by highlighting the tool’s key components, and the main conclusions resulting from the validation analysis of CPAT.\n\n\n3.1.3 Niche & Use cases for CPAT\nCPAT requires minimal training to be used effectively. Computer literacy, basic familiarity with Excel, and some understanding of economic and climate concepts. Flexibility is built-in for the more advanced user, to allow for different assumptions than those in the default assumption set and for choosing among various data inputs. Advanced users can also input their own data.\nAlthough CPAT is powerful even on its own, it is still advisable to use it alongside other tools that may have a more granular representation, of say, technological detail, sectors, feedback mechanisms, trade linkages, behavioral responses, etc. CPAT is designed to be light on resource and skill needs, providing a rapid first-cut analysis when one seeks to test various carbon pricing designs.\nThe carbon tax is the most effective instrument for emissions reduction in CPAT. By default, its coverage spans the whole economy, but the user can also set this to select sectors. The ETS covers the whole economy by default with the option also to select coverage. A key assumption is that the ETS and carbon tax are equivalent in a frictionless market with full auctioning. While the ETS design lets the user select prices (rather than quantities), frictions imply that ETS is not as effective at reducing emissions as a carbon tax. The user can choose the initial carbon tax level, when to commence carbon pricing, the target carbon price, the year that the target level is achieved, and the sectoral coverage of the carbon tax.\nStrengths and weaknesses of CPAT in relation to carbon pricing schemes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry’s needs\nYes/No\nRemarks\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding which instrument (ETS or tax) to choose.\nNo\nLike most other deterministic models, CPAT assumes that the ETS yields the same price as a carbon tax and does not currently consider offset markets.\n\n\nAssessing the impacts of carbon price on the economy, employment, energy/fuel prices\nYes\nCPAT provides an assessment of macroeconomic performance, energy consumption and price changes, emission reductions, distributional consequences, and co-benefits (health and traffic) of carbon pricing reform.\n\n\nDifferent allowance allocation mechanisms\nPartial\nCPAT has an effectiveness and revenue parameter for ETSs.\n\n\nWith and without consideration of offsets\nNo\nSee above\n\n\nDifferent carbon tax rates for different sectors\nYes\nCPAT has a consistent carbon price that can be exempted by sector and/or fuel type. There is also an excise reform table that allows fuel and sector-specific pricing.\n\n\nThe potential distributional impacts of introducing a carbon price\nYes\nThis requires household expenditure survey data. If this data is not already available within CPAT, it must be entered to access the reform’s distributional consequences.\n\n\nUnderstanding the potential “co-benefits” of introducing a carbon price.\nYes\nReduction in local pollutants and traffic co-benefits associated with carbon pricing reform are currently represented in the model.\n\n\nAre all sectors represented in CPAT?\nYes\nCPAT brackets the economy into 17 sectors.\n\n\nDoes CPAT account for pre-existing policies?\nYes\nCPAT also allows the user to phase pre-existing subsidies, for instance, or exemptions if these have been added during instrument design.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Critical Policy and Modelling Choices\nThe reviewer should be aware of a few critical modeling choices.\nFirst, the user has the option to as well as a carbon price to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Those are shown on the top right of the main policy panel.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Main Settings Panel\n\n\nThere is the option (default to on) to convert the carbon price into a GHG tax across all sectors (including LULUCF, Waste, etc.) See the red dash on the bottom left of the panel above.\nThe user can default to the Variable Renewable Energy maximum scale-up rate (See red arrow above). The default is ‘Country Specific,’ which gives and adds additional solar generation of 2% of the total power generated each year plus an extra 2% for wind (except for China which has 2.5% for solar and 2.5% for wind). The implications of these maximum scale-up rates are in the second panel below, bottom right.\nInvestment behavior in state-owned power sectors responds to the carbon tax as a shadow price of carbon for government investment, i.e., we assume state plans respond as well as the private sector.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Power Setting Panel\n\n\nFourth, CPAT, by default, has two ad hoc adjustments: a Covid adjustment for 2021 and 2022 and a coal share adjustment. The engineer power model coal share adjustment is a country-specific value for some countries that adds an intangible cost to coal generation (representing regulations not captured in CPAT plus lack of flexibility relative to natural gas). That adjustment can be turned off in the power setting panel (around row 131). The setting is calibrated to current coal shares and long-term IEA projections.\n\n\n3.1.5 Data choices in CPAT\n\n3.1.5.1 Key data used\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, Appendix G, ‘Data sources,’ gives an overview of the data used in the mitigation module.\n\n\n\nThe main data sources are IEA data, various World Bank data sources, IIASA data for emissions, and Energy Prices and Energy projections are primarily from the IMF (from multiple processes).\n\n\n3.1.5.2 Key parameters and choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections of the Mitigation documentation detailing the key parameters and their methodology, if estimated:\n\nElasticities: 3.3.5 Income and Price Elasticities of Demand\nAutonomous efficiency improvement: 3.3.5.6 Rates of technological change and exogenous rebound effects and 3.4.2.3 Power demand. Also, see caveats.\nRenewable scale up rate: Section 3.4.2.4 ‘Power supply.’\nCapEx: Section 3.4.4 ’Power sector data sources and parameter choices.’\n\n\n\n\nThe following key parameters in CPAT rely on different data sources or assumptions:\n\nElasticities concerning prices and income are derived from Burke and Csereklyei (2016) using the relationship from Gertler et al. (2016)\n\n\n\nThe exogenous time trend or autonomous efficiency improvement is set based on IEA’s data and experts’ judgment. Values are different across sectors and fuels. See the caveats section.\n\n\n\nRenewable scale up rates are set so that the user can choose a low, medium, high, or very high rate, corresponding to 1, 2, 3, and 4% of additional generation (as a proportion of total generation) per year, respectively. In addition, the CPAT dashboard provides transparency on country-specific scale-up historical rate, should the user decide to use a more specified rate as the one defined under the settings.\n\n\n\nThe engineer power model relies on forecast CapEx, subject to a learning rate methodology for renewable energies.\n\n\n\n3.1.5.3 Key calibration exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration exercises are presented under the corresponding section. In particular:\n\nOverall energy use through Covid adjustment in 2020 and 2021: Section 3.3.4.4 ’Calibration of overall energy use through Covid adjustment in 2020 and 2021.’\nCalibration in the engineer power model: Section 3.4.2.4 see sub-section ‘Calibration.’\nEmissions: Section 3.5 ‘Emissions.’\nLong-term storage is based on electrolyzes Section 3.4.2.5 see sub-section ‘Long-term storage.’\n\n\n\n\nA calibration exercise is performed for some key variables to prevent the model from deviating from observed data (i.e., for 2019 to 2021) and ensure a proper starting trajectory, particularly in the context of Covid. Against this background, the following adjustments have been made:\n\nOverall energy use through Covid adjustment in 2020 and 2021: Due to the unprecedented global economic shock induced by Covid-19, the energy consumption factor makes an ad hoc adjustment to the model and is calibrated using emissions outturn as the overall numeraire in 2020 and 2021.\nCalibration in the engineer power model:\n\nTotal electricity generation: A COVID adjustment factor can be used to calibrate total electricity generation. The latter, estimated by the model, is compared to observed data (IEA, 2020). It is worth mentioning that the default in CPAT does not account for this calibration, but this calibration can be turned on.\nShare of coal: The share of coal in electricity generation is calibrated to observed data in 2019 and 2020 (IEA, 2019 and 2020). The calibration uses an additional implicit price for coal – if necessary – to match the observed share of coal.\n\nEmissions: In 2019, both \\(CO_{2}\\) and \\(CH_{4}\\) energy-related emissions are scaled to UNFCCC inventory emissions, meaning they are multiplied by a factor such that base-year emissions are equal in the model and the inventory.\nLong-term storage is based on electrolysers: Given its interseasonal storage and geographic independence, we focus on the costs of electrolysers for storage. This storage cost is thus assumed as long-term storage and is measured with the interface (i.e., electrolysers) as the numeraire.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Testing and validation summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full validation analysis of the mitigation module is presented in Section 3.8 of the documentation.\n\n\n\nThe validation of the mitigation module is composed of several elements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis performed\nMain conclusions\n\n\n\n\nElasticities estimations. As CPAT is mainly driven by elasticities with respect to prices and economic activity, an econometric analysis is carried out to compare the elasticities used in CPAT and those obtained from empirical analysis.\nThe empirical validation pointed out that the elasticities with respect to price and economic activity in CPAT tend to be in the same ballpark as those estimated here, with some exceptions related to road transport and the service sector.\n\n\nComparison of CPAT against other models.6 This analysis comprises comparisons between CPAT and Enerdata, IEA, and EPM models.\nOverall, the comparison analysis shows comparable results between CPAT and other models with a few exceptions most likely linked to different components in fuel aggregation, divergent assumptions regarding nuclear, country-specific divergence (e.g., Russia), or Covid adjustment.\n\n\nEx-post studies. This section presents the literature’s estimates of the effectiveness of carbon pricing with respect to emissions and compares them to the CPAT results.\nWhen looking into the range of CPAT’s estimates across all sectors, results are comparable with those of the literature. At the sector level, the power sector records the highest decrease in the long run, which is consistent with the literature.\n\n\nHindcasting. The hindcasting exercise aims at testing CPAT’s forecasts against observed data. It searches to evaluate the performance of the assumptions used when trying to reproduce historical information.\nFor the countries analyzed, CPAT generally fits the trend of observed data. There are some discrepancies and periods where gaps appear. However, for certain periods/countries, discrepancies of volatile magnitudes appear between CPAT projections and observed emissions. While this may result from implementing policies that were not modeled in the exercise, it can also result from discrepancies in price forecasting.\n\n\nParameter Sensitivity Analysis. The analysis explores the sensitivity of a set of selected parameters.\nThe sensitivity of the parameters to CPAT to CO2 emissions ranges from no effect to very sensitive when focusing on the relative changes (i.e., CO2 emissions reduction relative to the default parameter).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.7 Status of upgrades since the last review\nThere have been many upgrades to CPAT since the last review, and the table below gives a partial list to give the reviewer an idea of the improvements.

Sections of this document could also complement this section by presenting the upgrades made to CPAT since the last review and outlining desired upgrades, known issues, and valuable analyses not completed.\n\n3.1.8.1 Policy modeling\nCPAT abstracts from the possibility of:\n\nDesigning complex policy packages, including a combination of instruments (e.g., ETS, carbon tax, and offsets) and accounting for mitigation actions in the baseline scenario (beyond those already captured in recently observed fuel use/price data and known carbon pricing mechanisms). However, policy combinations can be done sequentially — analyze one policy and use this outcome as the new baseline for the next policy, etc. In the same vein, CPAT does not account for international linkages across countries or emissions leakage, which prevents explicit analysis of the implications of border carbon adjustments which are receiving increased attention.\nDifferences in fuel price responsiveness may vary across countries with the structure of the energy system and regulations on energy prices or emission rates. Nonetheless, this latter default can be easily adjusted in individual country analysis. In addition, feedback from carbon pricing, like the impact of carbon pricing reform on commodity prices or interest rates which could be feedback to affect emission reductions, cannot be easily designed in an Excel-based tool.\nNon-linear responses to significant policy changes, such as rapid adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies (deployed in the power and industry sectors) or even direct air capture.\nUpward sloping fuel supply curves and changes in international fuel prices that might result from simultaneous climate or energy price reform in large countries. CPAT is parameterized to behave like the mid-point of the broader modeling literature. Although many models account for these factors, no big difference is observed, given the relatively flat supply curves for coal.\nApplying different coverage levels across sector groups. CPAT allows the user to select the sectors and fuels to be considered for policy implementation:\n\nFor new policies, the coverage is binary, whether they are included or not.\nWhenever the user defines exemptions for fuels or sectors and determines a phaseout period for those exemptions, the coverage can be fractional during that period.\nFor existing policies, instead, the coverage is mostly fractional, and it is currently computed as an average of the fuel demand covered across sector groups or fuel types.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.8.2 Prices\nWhen it comes to prices, CPAT does not model:\n\nUpward sloping fuel supply curves and changes in international fuel prices that might result from simultaneous climate or energy price reform in large countries—parameter values are, however, chosen such that the results from the model are broadly consistent with those from far more detailed energy models that, to varying degrees, account for these sorts of factors (see Section 3.8.3).\nInstitutional setup driving prices. In CPAT, energy demand responds to prices in the private sector, although the institutional setup could, in some markets, prevent prices from determining supply and demand.\n\n\n\n3.1.8.3 Emissions\nThe following limitations and constraints exist when computing the emissions:\n\nIn the current version of CPAT, international linkages across countries or emissions leakage are not factored in. This prevents explicit analysis (in the first public version) of the implications of border carbon adjustments which are receiving increased attention.\nEnergy related N2O emissions are calibrated on CO2 emissions preventing the independence of one from the other.\nIn the case of LULUCF CO2 emissions, a condition to model the sink activity can create an irreversible state of a positive sink (more absorptions than emissions). Even if the previous year’s emissions (the year before the base year)B are negative, there is no possibility of returning to a negative sink.\n\n\n\n3.1.8.4 Energy use (all energy sectors)\nA first important caveat, common to all of our approaches, lies in the fact that the autonomous efficiency improvement and time trend of consumer preferences and technology are treated in the same way. In other words, it is implicitly assumed that the time trend of consumer preferences and technology is not varying. However, it can be subject to changes over time. For instance, technology can get more or less energy intensive as it changes.\n\n\n3.1.8.5 Power sector\nThe two different power models in CPAT have different strengths and weaknesses. For ‘off-the-shelf’ use, we recommend using the average of the two models. We recommend the techno-economic (‘engineer’) power model specified with detailed modeling choices and input parameters for more tailored use.\nThe elasticity-based power model is responsive to relative price changes but not absolute prices. It does not explicitly model the capital stock, so it cannot distinguish between short-run capacity factor differences and long run capital stock changes. Thus, changes in generation for fixed capacity stock generation types may be too fast. It may also model unrealistic reductions in generation from renewables if their price were to increase relative to other options. Conversely, changes in generation for dispatchable types may be insufficiently responsive to price. The model could produce outcomes that are not physically realistic.\nThe techno-economic ‘engineer’ power model has the following caveats:\n\nInvestment behavior in state-owned power sectors responds to the carbon tax as a shadow price of carbon for government investment, i.e., we assume state plans respond as well as the private sector.\nThe power maximum retirement rate for coal is set to 80%.\nEstimates of national capacity by generation type across time. Since no such dataset exists globally, CPAT’s current approach relies on its own estimates. Fossil capacity collected from the EIA is scaled using independently estimated shares.\nIn CPAT, the investment decision is not fully commercial but assumes a quasi-least cost approach to meeting aggregate energy demand (and power demand).\nFiscal expenditures of government investment in power are not accounted for. Such a feature is not implemented, partly because power investment is typically funded by customers even if financed by the government – so including it would raise consistency issues.\nThere could be a better assessment of flexibility (and ease of implementing VRE) based on the capacity reserve.\nLosses associated with round-trip efficiency (i.e., the ratio between the power put in and the energy retrieved from storage) are currently not accounted for in the current model. Power storage consumes electricity and saves it to hand it then back to the grid. The higher the round-trip efficiency, the less energy is lost in the storage process.\n\n\n\n3.1.8.6 Desirable upgrades, known issues, and useful analyses not completed: General\nThis section contains our assessment of upgrades that are desirable but were not able to be completed. We do not propose to do all these upgrades and seek the reviewer’s opinions if any of them are must-haves before releasing CPAT to the broader community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue\nComment/Status\n\n\n\n\nEmissions Factors from IIASA include process emissions and are then calibrated\nThe current approach to IIASA emissions factors (which, inappropriately, include process emissions) and then calibrating total emissions is unsatisfactory. Perhaps use detailed energy balances to determine weighted average CO2 Efs. Priority: low\n\n\nA better methane model (and, more generally, better models outside the energy sectors) is needed\nThe IMF plans to upgrade the methane model.\n\n\nShort and long-term elasticity distinctions not included\nWe now eliminated the distinction between the short and long run. However, we think this is important, particularly for residential power demand, which is inelastic in the short term. We intend to revisit this in 2.0.\n\n\nCovid adjustment is ad hoc\nThe Covid adjustment for 2020 is unsatisfactory and may be partly a response to the lack of the short-term/long-term distinction (i.e., too high price elasticities in the short term). I am not sure we can improve it due to the asymmetric nature of the shock. However, it might be better to still go with differences from the outturn. It can be turned off.\n\n\nRegulatory policy\nThe semantics of the shadow price of regulatory policy options and then the 70% effectiveness weighting is highly unclear\n\n\nTime Trend is not backed by detailed research and only relates (notionally) to efficiency improvement rather than other components of the time trend\nThe current time trend includes energy efficiency (negative trend). Still, there are also positive trend components to the time trend (e.g., shifts in tastes toward SUVs) that may not be captured in the income elasticity. Could reestimate the model.\n\n\nIncome elasticity: how to get away from that? Is there a relationship with a CGE model, rather than using this, which can be crude?\nIt was not implemented. No plans to adjust this.\n\n\nA closer connection to sectoral GVA forecasting might be desirable\nTo be discussed further.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.8.7 Power Sector Models\n\nCPAT does not aim to replace models like EPM; thus, we have limited the upgrades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nPower supply feebates are implemented in the engineering model. Power efficiency feebates are in the elasticity model.\nIt would be better if both models would do both types of feebates.\n\n\nThe elasticity model could be phased out\nCurrently, we recommend the ‘average’ of two models. Could move to engineer model as a recommendation.\n\n\nLand area-related physical limits\nNo change has been implemented – No current plans.\n\n\nInterest rates not applied to the construction period\nTBC\n\n\nPart of the levelized cost is to do with the actual capacity factor (the fixed operation and maintenance), and this could drive retirement\nNo change has been implemented – No current plans.\n\n\nDo not calculate the capacity reserve margin explicitly\nNo change has been implemented – No current plans.\n\n\nDo not use residual Load curves or representative days, as they are viewed as too complex for Excel\nNo change has been implemented – No current plans.\n\n\nWe do not have resource curves; wind global wind costs are irrelevant. This is very significant for hydro, for example\nFor hydro and nuclear we recommend using exogenous scale up. These default to no investment before 2030 and only allow investment after this point if the generation type is already present\n\n\nCalibrate storage requirements at a regional level\nNo change has been implemented – No current plans.\n\n\nExplicitly estimate ‘k’ in the logit model (how sharply the sigmoidal function cuts out more expensive options)\nNo change has been implemented – No current plans.\n\n\nConcerning State-Owned Enterprises (e.g., in Power Sector), we might want to make the investment/derisking decision explicit in these cases rather than relying on the carbon tax. That would reduce the effectiveness of a carbon tax but might be better communication of what MoFs need to do regarding the direction of SOEs.\nNot currently implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.8.8 Remaining Known Bugs or Issues\n\nA model as complex as CPAT has some ongoing issues. These are stated here and are, in most cases, minor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nPPAs\nPPAs only affect dispatch and so have limited effect in the long term. Probably not an issue, but it needs an investigation.\n\n\nState-owned power markets; Investment decision\nCurrently, the investment decision is driven by the carbon price, representing a shadow price for investment appraisal. This needs to be flagged more strongly for regulated power markets either in the documentation or in CPAT, or an option to explicitly add/remove a shadow price for investment appraisal.\n\n\nBhutan and elasticity power model\nIssue when in the elasticity model that the balances do not fully balance between energy consumption and energy supply and when exports or imports are substantial (e.g., in Bhutan).\n\n\nRussia\nRussia’s results need to be confirmed.\n\n\nSmall Countries\nThere are some issues with a few smaller economies. See the appendix showing the country list working. We do not intend to remediate all countries due to data limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.9 Notation and Acronyms\nA table summarizing the Notation used is available in each modeling section.

    "text": "3.2 Fuel prices, taxes, and subsidies\n\n3.2.1 Overview\nAt the time of writing, the base year for CPAT is 2019. The base year plus the next two years (2020 and 2021) are considered the ‘historical price years’ for CPAT. The algorithm for the historical price years and the future price years is different; we use historical price information in the historical price years and a forecast approach for the future price years.\nDomestic price information for historical time periods comes from a dataset created by the IMF side of the joint WB-IMF team. We refer to this dataset as the ‘IMF dataset’. Information about this dataset is available from the IMF and is not part of this documentation. The user can supplement these data with specifically-sourced data (‘manual inputs’).\nTo forecast domestic prices, we also use projections of international fuel prices (for example, crude oil prices). These forecasts are created as an average of internationally recognized sources. The default is an average of IMF and WB projections, although other options are available if the user chooses. The user should however make sure that these sources are updated.\nWhile the method used to build the data may change from the ‘historical price years’ to the years where fuel prices are forecasted, the identity to obtain retail prices \\(p_{\\text{cgft}}\\) (for a given country \\(c\\), sectors grouping \\(g\\) and fuel type \\(f\\), during period \\(t\\)) remains the same: Retail prices equal the supply price plus all relevant taxes. As for latter, the different hierarchies, coverage, exemptions, and types of tax, require additional disaggregations. For instance, value added taxes may be paid on top of other taxes and fees, so it will be convenient to express the retail price identity as:\n\\(p_{\\text{cgft}} = sp_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{va}t_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{tx}o_{\\text{cgft}}\\)\nwhere \\(\\text{sp}\\) stands for the supply price, \\(\\text{vat}\\) is the value added tax, and \\(\\text{txo}\\) stands for the excise and all other taxes. Furthermore, \\(\\text{txo}\\) acts as net additional taxes, as it corresponds to the addition of the consumer subsidies \\(\\text{cs}\\), fixed or ad valorem taxes \\(\\text{fao}\\), any existing carbon price \\(\\text{xcp}\\), and any new carbon price \\(\\text{ncp}\\):\n\\(\\text{tx}o_{\\text{cgft}} = cs_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{fa}o_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{xc}p_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{nc}p_{\\text{ocgft}}\\)\nNote that the existing and new carbon prices may result from policies related either to carbon taxation or ETS permit prices, as it will be explained in upcoming sections.\nThe table below summarizes the process used to build the information for prices and subsidies for the base years and the forecasted period.

Within the sector group, prices are equal – although more granular sectoral exemptions mean that prices in the sector can differ.\n\n\n3.2.3 Base years: Sources of information\nThe IMF dataset on prices and subsidies includes data for supply costs, producer subsidies, VAT, excise and other taxes, consumer subsidies, and retail prices by country, sector group and fuel type. This dataset is, hence, at the core of the information for historical prices used in CPAT. Existing policies (carbon taxation or ETS permits) with information both in terms of carbon price levels as well as the fuel and sector coverage, complete the dataset for CPAT’s ‘historical price years’. A brief description of the price components used in CPAT is provided below:\nHistorical retail price: Included in the IMF data set. Rounding errors aside, it equals the sum of supply costs, VAT, and excise and other taxes.\nSupply price: Included in the IMF data set. It is calculated as a weighted average of domestic extraction costs and international prices plus transport costs, where the weights refer to the proportion of the components that are domestically produced or imported.\n\nVAT: Included in the IMF data set. Computed as VAT collected over total sales (for a given fuel and sector), or as the result of applying a country or sector-specific VAT rate to the sales of a fuel to a sector.\nConsumer Subsidy: Included in the IMF data set. Computed as total subsidy over total sales (for a given fuel and sector).\nProducer Subsidy: Included in the IMF data set. Computed as total subsidy over total sales (for a given fuel).\nExisting Carbon Price: Sourced from State and Trends of Carbon Pricing.\nNew Carbon Price: User-defined. It is typically zero in the base years.\nFixed ad valorem and other taxes: Balancing item, computed as a residual: \\(fao = txo - cs - xcp - ncp\\).\n\n\n3.2.4 Forecasted years: Construction of data on prices and taxes\nSupply price for a fuel type \\(f\\) in a given country \\(c\\) and sector grouping \\(g\\) and during period \\(t\\), is calculated using a coefficient of supply prices to base years (2017-2019) to the global prices in the same period, multiplied by the respective international fuel price in year \\(t\\):\n\\(sp_{cgft} = \\frac{sp_{cgf,t-1}}{gp_{f,t-1}}*gp_{ft}\\)\nwhere \\(sp_{cgf,t-1}\\) denotes the lagged supply price for country \\(c\\), fuel \\(f\\) in sector \\(g\\), \\(gp_{f,t-1}\\) is the lagged global fuel price.\nIn practice, the supply prices dependence on global prices may not be the same for a country that produces the fuel vs. one that imports it. Moreover, the supply price can be affected by any existing producer-side subsidies, as well as by simulated policies where these would be phased out. The treatment of these advanced cases is presented in Section 3.9.3. \nVAT payment equals the previous year’s VAT payment ratio to the supply price multiplied by the current year’s supply price:\n\\(vat_{cgft} = \\frac{vat_{cgf,t - 1}}{sp_{cgf,t - 1}}*sp_{cgft}\\)\nNOTE: 1. Users are given the option to include \\(txo\\) as part of the VAT base; 2. The residential and transport sectors may instead be computed by applying a nation-wide constant VAT rate to the VAT base (\\(sp\\), here).\nConsumer-side fossil fuel subsidy: Based on the fixed part of consumer subsidy per unit of energy, the new value is adapted to account for phasing-out of consumer side subsidies and the phasing out of price controls.\n\\(cs_{cgft} = cs_{cgf,t_0}*\\phi_{\\text{CS},t} + \\left( pcc_{cf} - 1 \\right)*\\left( \\Delta gp_{ft}*\\phi_{\\text{PC},t} \\right)\\)\nwhere \\(\\phi_{\\text{CS}}\\) is the phase-out factor for consumer-side subsidies, \\(\\phi_{\\text{PC}}\\) is the phase-out factor for price controls, \\(pcc_{cf}\\) is the price control coefficient and \\(\\Delta gp_{ft}\\) is the difference between current and previous global prices.\nFixed, ad valorem and other taxes are projected based on last year’s information. There are two possible cases:\n\\(fao_{cgft} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} \\frac{\\Sigma fao_{cgf,t_0}}{n_{t_0}} & \\text{if fixed} \\\\ \\frac{fao_{cgf,t - 1}}{sp_{cgf,t - 1}}*sp_{cgf,t} & \\text{if ad valorem} \\ \\end{matrix} \\right\\}\\)\nwhere \\(\\frac{\\Sigma fao_{cgf,t_0}}{n_{t_0}}\\) represents the average value of \\(fao\\) during the base years.\nExisting Carbon Price: Resulting for already implemented carbon taxes or ETS permits and their prices, it is assumed that these policies are complemented by any new measure selected by the user. Thus, the price is assumed to be equal to the latest available observation:\n\\(xcp_{cgft} = xcp_{cgf,t - 1} = xct_{cgf,t - 1}*\\left( 1 + \\delta_{\\text{CT}} \\right) + xetsp_{cgf,t - 1}*\\left( 1 + \\delta_{\\text{ETS}} \\right)\\)\nwith \\(xct_{cgf,t - 1}\\) and \\(xetsp_{cgf,t - 1}\\) representing the existing carbon taxes and ETS permit prices per energy unit, respectively. As part of the advanced options, CPAT allows the user to select a fix growth rate for each – the existing carbon tax and the existing ETS permit price. This is captured by the parameter \\(\\delta\\) in both cases.\nNew Carbon Price: It accounts for the price resulting from the implementation of new policies (carbon taxation or ETS permit prices), such that \\(ncp_{cgft} = nct_{cgft} + netsp_{cgft}\\), which can be further decomposed as:\n\\(ncp_{cgft} = NCT_{\\text{ct}}*ef_{cgf}*\\varphi_{\\text{NCT},cgft} + NETSP_{ct}*ef_{cgf}*\\varphi_{\\text{NETS},cgft}\\)\nwhere \\(nct_{cgft}\\) and \\(netsp_{cgft}\\) stand for the new carbon tax per energy unit and the new ETS price per energy unit, respectively. In both cases, the value per energy unit is obtained based on the national price per ton of \\(CO2\\) (\\(NCT_{ct}\\) or \\(NETSP_{ct}\\)), and scaling it by the country-sector-fuel specific emission factors, \\(ef_{cgf}\\), and the sector-fuel coverage for the new policies within the country in question (\\(\\varphi_{\\text{NCT},cgft}\\) and \\(\\varphi_{\\text{NETS},cgft}\\)).\nAmong the options available, the user can select the sector or fuel that will be exempted from the policy implemented. This is already considered in the sector-fuel coverage \\(\\varphi\\). Moreover, such exemptions can be phased out according to user-defined parameters.\nNote that both the existing and the new ETS permit prices per ton of CO2, \\(XETSP_{c,t}\\) and \\(NETSP_{c,t}\\) respectively, correspond to the adjusted values after the penalization. In other words, to the value comparable to the level of a carbon tax. For more information on this, refer to Section 3.9.3.\nExcise and other taxes are computed as the sum of its forecasted components.\n\\(txo_{cgf,t} = cs_{cgf,t} + fao_{cgf,t} + xcp_{cgf,t} + ncp_{cgf,t}\\)\nRetail price for fuel \\(f\\) in sector \\(s\\) in years \\(t\\) is the sum of the supply price, VAT, and excise and other taxes.\n\\(p_{cgf,t} = sp_{cgf,t} + \\text{va}t_{cgf,t} + \\text{tx}o_{cgf,t} = sp_{cgf,t} + \\text{va}t_{cgf,t} + \\left( cs_{cgf,t} + \\text{fa}o_{cgf,t} + \\text{xc}p_{cgf,t} + \\text{nc}p_{cgf,t} \\right)\\)\n\nIt should be noted that, while this relationship is true for all cases, for the baseline scenario the new carbon price component, included in \\(txo\\), is null.\n\n\n3.2.5 Price aggregation\nFor reporting purposes, it is convenient to have an aggregate price for each type of fuel within a country. This price, computed for each scenario, is obtained as a weighted average of the sector-specific retail prices, where the weights are given by the total use of fuel \\(f\\) in country \\(c\\):\n\\(P_{cf,t} = \\sum_g {\\frac{F_{cgf,t}}{\\sum_g F_{cgf,t}}*p_{cgf,t}}\\)\nwhere \\(P_{cf,t}\\) is the aggregate price for fuel \\(f\\) in country \\(c\\), \\(F_{cgf,t}\\) is the use of fuel \\(f\\) in sector \\(g\\) within country \\(c\\), and \\(\\sum_g F_{cgf,t}\\) is the aggregation of the fuel \\(f\\) use across all sectors in that country."

    "text": "3.3 Fuel Consumption\n\n3.3.1 Overview\nCPAT’s mitigation module is based on a fundamental model structure described in a recent IMF (2019) paper. Energy use responds to energy prices and real GDP (total real GDP, not per capita GDP). The price elasticity includes a ‘usage’ response (e.g., how much each car is used) and an ‘energy efficiency’ (e.g., how fuel efficient the car is) component. The fuel equation estimate fuel consumption in the different sector groupings of CPAT.\nIn what follows, we present the equation form and then specific cases in which the equation might be slightly transformed or in which we factor in additional technologies in accordance with the sector under consideration, that is Transport, Buildings, Industry, Other Energy Use and Electricity.\n\n\n3.3.2 Notation\nThe table below presents the notations used in the section and the name of the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are reported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made to ensure that they match our calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\nVariable\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(F\\)\nUse of fuel\nktoe\n\n\n\\(Y\\)\nTotal real GDP\nUS$\n\n\n\\(p\\)\nRetail price\nUS$/Gj\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\)\nAutonomous annual energy efficiency improvement\n%\n\n\n\\(\\Psi\\)\nCovid adjustment factor to energy demand\n%\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{Y}\\)\nForward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel demand\n%\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{U}\\)\nElasticity of usage of energy products and services\n%\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{F}\\)\nEfficiency price elasticity\n%\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{\\text{bio},f}\\)\nSubstitution elasticity between the most cooking fuel used and biomass\nUS$/Gj\n\n\n\\(\\text{Ef}f_{f}\\)\nNatural gas, LPG and kerosene efficiency\n%\n\n\n\\(\\text{Ef}f_{\\text{bio}}\\)\nBiomass efficiency\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Fuel Consumption Dynamics\nThe fuel use for fuel type \\(f\\) and sector \\(s\\) can be related to the fuel use in the previous year as follows:\n\\(\\frac{F_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{F_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha_{\\text{sf}}} \\right)^{1 + \\epsilon_{U,c\\text{sf}}}\\Psi_{\\text{ct}}\\left( \\frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{Y,\\text{csf}}}\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}}}\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{F,\\text{csf}}\\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}} \\right)}\\)\nwhere the main components of the equation are \\(F\\), the fuel usage in ktoe, \\(Y\\), the total real GDP, the prices \\(p\\) as presented in Section 3.2, \\(\\alpha\\), the autonomous annual energy efficiency improvement and, \\(\\Psi\\), a Covid adjustment factor to energy demand (see Section 3.3.4.4). Note that additional policies affecting the parameter \\(\\alpha\\) can be manually added.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Dashboard: Additional policy-induced efficiency gains by sector\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{Y}\\) denotes the forward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel demand for fuel \\(f\\) in sector \\(g\\). It thus translates a 1% increase in total real GDP into a fuel demand increase. CPAT does not distinguish between the elasticity for real-GDP-per-capita and the elasticity for population.\n\\(\\epsilon_{U}\\), is the elasticity of usage of energy products and services (i.e.B for a 1% increase in prices, how much will total usage be affected in the same year).\nFinally, \\(\\epsilon_{F}\\) denotes the efficiency price elasticity.\nFor more information on the elasticities and the autonomous annual energy efficiency improvement, see Section 3.3.5. The latter is set to 0.5% or 1%, depending on the sector.\nThe terms of the energy use equation represent:\n\nA GDP effect \\(\\left( \\frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{Y,\\text{csf}}}\\)\nA price effect on usage \\(\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}}}\\)\nA price effect on energy efficiency, \\(\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{F,\\text{csf}}\\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}} \\right)}\\)\n\nBoth autonomous and price-driven efficiency components are subject to rebound effects by raising to the power of \\(\\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U} \\right)\\), where \\(\\epsilon_{U}\\) is negative.\nNote that the term effect on energy efficiency is affected by the shadow price12 in case non-pricing policy types are implemented, that is feebates and power feebates, energy efficiency regulations, vehicle fuel economy, residential and industrial efficiency regulations. In the equation, the shadow price only affects the efficiency margin and not the price effect since, for instance, an energy efficiency regulation does not aim to increase prices but increases the efficiency.\nFor simplicity, we assume that all the effects take place over the course of one year. In reality, some effects will take time, but CPAT abstracts from these effects. CPAT is more suited to anticipated and progressively phased policies over the medium term.\nEnergy use is aggregated into five main sector groupings: Transport, Buildings, Industry, Other Energy Use and Electricity demand.\n\n\n3.3.4 Specific cases\nFew specific cases slightly affect the energy use equation described above or the energy composition, that is:\n\nThe breakdown of biofuels and existence of jet fuel in the transport sectors;\nSelf-generated renewables in the building and industry sectors;\nThe substitution between biomass and LPG/kerosene/natural gas in the residential sector;\nFor the year 2020-21, energy use is calibrated with a Covid adjustment;\nFuel transformation; and\nOther energy use sector.\n\n\n3.3.4.1 Biofuels and jet fuel\nIn the transport sector, for road transport only, biomass is further broken down into Bioethanol, Biodiesel and Other Biofuels. In addition, domestic aviation jet fuel is a fuel type not seen in other sectors.\n\n\n3.3.4.2 Self-generated renewables\nWhen aggregating energy use at the sector level, power generated outside of the power sector, that is self-generated renewables, is also accounted for. The energy use equation is the same as the one presented above, and the price used is that of solar energy.\n\n\n3.3.4.3 Biomass substitution in the residential sector\nWhen aggregating energy used, an option to account for leakage into biomass in the residential sector is available.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Sectors disaggregation in CPAT\n\n\nIf this option is turned on, a percent change of the most used cooking fuel (i.e., natural gas, LPG or kerosene) is transferred to biomass. In other words, the relative price change in the most used cooking fuel results in a percentage change in its consumption; this variation change is substituted by biomass. The latter is composed of the substitution elasticity between the most cooking fuel used and biomass (\\(\\epsilon_{\\text{bio},f}\\)), but also accounts for the relative efficiency between the fuels considered, that is only natural gas, LPG and kerosene (\\(f = \\text{nga},\\text{lpg\\ and\\ ker}\\)) and biomass (\\(\\text{Ef}f_{f}\\) and \\(\\text{Ef}f_{\\text{bio}}\\), respectively):\n\\(\\epsilon_{\\text{bio},f}*\\frac{\\text{Ef}f_{\\text{bio}}}{\\text{Ef}f_{f}}\\)\nThe substitution elasticity between the most cooking fuel used and biomass, \\(\\epsilon_{\\text{bio},f}\\), is 0.25 (see Section 3.3.5 for more information). The efficiency13 for each fuel is detailed in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy type\n\n\nEfficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural gas\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n\n\nLPG\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n\n\nKerosene\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n\n\nBiomass\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n\n\nThe proportion of the natural gas transferred to biomass is thus dependent on the relative efficiency of representative stoves that are used. Therefore, for a 10% price change in, for instance, natural gas, 0.9% of natural gas consumption is shifted to biomass.\n\n\n3.3.4.4 Calibration of overall energy use through Covid adjustment in 2020 and 2021\nDue to the unprecedented global economic shock induced by the Covid-19, the energy consumption factor makes an ad hoc adjustment to the model and is calibrated using emissions outturn as the overall numeration in 2020 and 2021.\nThis sets baseline 2020 emissions to equal estimates for most countries and applies a GDP-linked scalar adjustment for all other countries to match global emissions (difference in recent three-year average GDP growth vs 2020 growth rate times 1.4). For 2021, emissions are set for very large emitters (US, China, India, EU) to a specific rebound vs 2019 emissions per the Global Carbon Project (2021), and to a scalar that results in -4.2% vs 2019 emissions for all other countries. Estimates can be found at the end of the tab ‘GHG’.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Summary of Covid adjustment\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4.5 Fuel transformation\nIn CPAT we transform balances into final energy consumption (buildings, industry, transport, other), power sector (part of energy transformation in balances) and fuel transformation. The fuel transformation sector (FTR) is determined as the difference between primary and final energy consumption, subtracting Fuel Transformation in the power sector. This residual is treated as an additional industrial sector called fuel transformation.\nIn addition, all oil products and natural gas are aggregated to avoid dealing with negative fuel consumption. The FTR, computed as a residual, is treated as an additional industrial sector called ‘transformation’. For the forecasted years, its consumption follows the main mitigation fuel equations.\n\n\n3.3.4.6 Other energy use\nThe other energy use sector contains principally military fuel use. No carbon taxes are imposed in this sector.\n\n\n\n3.3.5 Income and Price Elasticities of Demand\n\n3.3.5.1 Overview\nThe current version of CPAT uses a derived set of elasticities based on Burke and Csereklyei (2016) using the relationship from Gertler et al. (2016)\n\n\n3.3.5.2 Income elasticities\nIncome elasticities relate to general energy demand (electricity, transport, industry, services, residential and other).\nIncome elasticities of energy demand are selected based on a broad literature review, simplified, adjusted for development levels, and sense-checked to a large dataset of income elasticities and outputs of other models. There are 32 ‘base’ income elasticates in CPAT covering eight energy sources (coal; natural gas; gasoline; diesel; other oil products like LPG and kerosene; biomass; small-scale renewables like solar PV; and electricity) and four sectors (transport including road, rail, aviation and shipping; residential; heavy industries; and public and private services).\nThese are then sense-checked against a database of income elasticities collected by the authors, which covers over 250 studies 2,000 observations of income elasticities across countries. Next, these are each adjusted for income per capita of the country considered in each projection period (‘adjusted income elasticities’) to reflect the broad finding that income elasticities decline with development. Lastly, the elasticities are checked once more through model intercomparison: comparing the baseline projections from those of many other global, regional, and country-specific models. The process is described further below.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Income elasticities: Base income elasticities of energy demand in CPA\n\n\nBase income elasticities for sectors are selected based on Burke and Csereklyei (2016), which covers 132 countries from 1960-2010. Fuel-specific elasticities within sectors are then selected based on a literature review such that the weighted global average income elasticity across fuels is within one standard deviation of those found for sectors (left panel of Figure 3.5). Broadly, energy demand grows more quickly in services, industry, transport, and other sector than it does in the residential or agricultural sectors.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: The relationship of fuel demand to GDP across countries by sector (left panel, mean estimated elasticities 1960-2010) and by development levels (right panel, unadjusted and adjusted elasticities with respect to log GDP 1985-2010) – Source: left panel from Burke and Csereklyei (2016); right panel inferred from Gertler and others (2016), adjusted upwards to match the global average income elasticity for energy in left panel\n\n\nIt is then further assumed that income elasticities have a reverse-U shape with respect to income levels. This relationship has been found by numerous studies (Gertler et al. (2016); Zhu et al.B 2018; Liddle and Huntington (2020); Caron and Fally (2022)). This non-homothetic relationship between incomes and energy could be reflective of the rapid rise in ownership of key energy consuming assets like refrigerators, air conditioners, and vehicles whose ownership tends to binary in nature (e.g.B households purchase one fridge but not additional fridges as they become wealthier;Gertler et al. (2016)). It could also reflect the Environmental Kuznets effect (as incomes increase economies reduce their environmental destruction by, for example, consuming fewer fossil fuels) (Saqib and Benhmad (2021)) or ‘dematerialization’ (richer countries tend to need fewer materials for marginal production and hence become more energy efficient).\nThe relationship between per capita incomes and energy demand is derived from Gertler et al. (2016) based on data cross-country analysis 1985-2010. This is then adjusted upwards such that the inferred global average income elasticity from this shape equals that found by Burke and Csereklyei (2016) (0.74, 2016) over the same time period (1960-2010). This adjustment is then applied to each base income elasticity’s base for each country over the projection period (varying with each year). The impact for selected fuel-sector pairs is shown in left panel below for per capita GDP and in the right panel for log GDP. Income elasticities jump up as countries graduate from being lower-income to a peak around lower-middle income status (at around $3,000 per capita) and then asymptotically decline until reaching the developed country maximum (at around $22,000 per capita).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Per capita GDP adjusted income elasticities, selected fuels/sectors by GDP (left) and log GDP (right)– Source: IMF staff using Burke and Csereklyei (2016), Gertler and others (2016), and various other sources.\n\n\nLastly, the results of these income elasticities on baseline energy consumption and emissions are then sense checked through a model inter-comparison. Overall, they allow for initially rapid accelerations in energy demand in developing countries (as households purchase energy-consuming goods like fridges, air conditioning units and cars) as well as broader structural change as countries increase the share of services in GDP and energy consumption.\n\n\n3.3.5.3 Price elasticities\nOwn-price elasticities of energy demand are parametrized using a similar approach to income elasticities. A major meta-study to estimate elasticities for fuels, which are then simplified and calibrated to allow for sectoral coverage, sense- and then finally sense checked to a large in-house dataset through model-intercomparison. These steps are described in turn.\nPrice elasticities in CPAT separated into two broad margins (see below). CPAT contains two types of price elasticities to distinguish between behavioral responses: the direct reduction in demand from reduced intensity of use from existing capital-consuming goods like vehicles (‘intensive margin’) and changes in the composition and scale of those goods (‘efficiency and extensive margin’). The two effects combined less the rebound effect (described later) correspond to the total price elasticity of demand, which is parametrized to the empirical literature14.\nThe initial source for price elasticities is a meta-study by Labandeira, Labeaga, and López-Otero (2017). This includes about 2,000 empirically estimated elasticities from 430 studies with broad global coverage of countries, seven fuels, and four sectors (refer to Table A for descriptive statistics). ‘Target’ estimates of elasticities for fuels and sectors are estimated, assuming that the base is the transport sector, plus deviations for the residential, industrial and services sectors (Table B)15. For any statistically insignificant values for fuels within sectoral regressions (natural gas in residential, for example), it is assumed that the difference between sectoral and base elasticities equal that sectors’ general elasticities multiplied by a scalar for all energy sources.\nAdditionally, there is evidence that price elasticities are slightly higher for developing countries (about Labandeira, Labeaga, and López-Otero (2017)). Price elasticities are therefore adjusted slightly upwards for developing countries (on the extensive margin) such that they are a similar magnitude higher than for developed countries.\nSimple price elasticities (rounded to 1 decimal point) on both the intensive and extensive margin are then calibrated to those targets. As shown in Table C, when weighting for developed and developing countries’ emissions, elasticities in CPAT are very similar (within 10%) to these target elasticities.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: Comparison of price elasticities\n\n\nThese, price elasticities are sense checked both against a large database of price elasticities (covering around 250 studies and 2,500 price elasticities), as well as through model intercomparison of CPAT results compared with those of other models. Both the baseline emissions projections and price responsiveness of emissions is broadly in line with that of other models, while median price elasticities are not significantly different for fuel-sector pairs collected across countries (though there is variation).\nLastly, all elasticities are long-term elasticities.\n\n\n3.3.5.4 Rebound effect\nWhen prices change, energy consumers also shift to more efficient energy-consuming goods. Marginal costs of fuel consumption are lower for more efficient goods (e.g.B each km travelled is cheaper for a vehicle with higher fuel economy), hence there is a corresponding increase in demand for those same fuels (‘direct rebound effect’). As marginal costs of fuel consumption decline, consumers also increase the intensity of consumption of these capital goods (e.g.B travel more miles in vehicles).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12: Implied direct rebound effects from prices (endogenous efficiency improvements increasing demand for energy\n\n\nThe energy use equation outlined in Section 3.3 allows rebound effects, \\(\\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U} \\right),\\) to be captured and compared to econometric estimates of rebound. Broadly, these align with the empirical literature. More specifically, the rebound effect is defined as the product of the energy efficiency elasticity and the usage elasticity, \\(\\epsilon_{F}*\\epsilon_{U}\\), as follows in the term affecting prices change:\n\\(\\left( \\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{F} + \\epsilon_{U} + \\epsilon_{F}*\\epsilon_{U}}\\)\nWith \\(\\epsilon_{F} = \\epsilon_{U} = - 0.3\\), the rebound effect represents 15.5% (i.e. the rebound effect reduces the total price elasticity by 15.5%). This result is lower, but seems more reasonable, than the estimates in a meta-analysis of 74 studies in Dimitropoulos, Oueslati, and Sintek (2018) (26-29% rebound effect, 2018).\nThe estimated leakage effects in residential natural gas (31%) are similar to those found in studies (20% to 30%, Haas and Biermayr (2000)).\n\n\n3.3.5.5 Cross-price elasticities\nCPAT contains three substitution or cross-price elasticities to account for the risk that households that face increases in costs for residential heating and cooking fuels shift to informal fuels like biomass. This ‘leakage’ effect can have a negative impact on household air pollution and hence welfare, which is calculated by CPAT’s air pollution module. These cross-price elasticities (biomass with respect to LPG and kerosene, as well gasoline with respect to diesel) are parameterized to the same broad literature review.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.13: Cross-price elasticities of substitution in CPAT\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5.6 Rates of technological change and exogenous rebound effects\nThe annual rate of exogenous technological change (that is, not induced by policies under consideration in CPAT) are set at between 0.5 and 1 percent per year for each fuel-sector pair.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.14: Exogenous efficiency improvements in energy-consuming capital goods (cars, buildings, factories)\n\n\nIt should be noted that – as with efficiency induced endogenously by price changes – exogenous efficiency improvements reduce marginal costs of energy consumption, hence there is some rebound effect that partly offsets the reduction in demand from improved efficiency. A large literature exists that examines the rebound effect from efficiency improvements, with estimates varying significantly, from 0 to 300% (see for example Saunders et al. (2021)). In CPAT, this rebound from exogenous efficiency improvements depends on the fuel-sector pair and its corresponding intensive margin and efficiency, but broadly it is between 20% to 60% across fuels and sectors.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.15: Rebound effect from exogenous efficiency improvements (% of emissions reduction reduced)\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5.7 References\n\nBelaC/d, Fateh, SalomC) Bakaloglou, and David Roubaud. 2018. “Direct Rebound Effect of Residential Gas Demand: Empirical Evidence from France.” Energy Policy 115: 23–31. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.040.\nBurke, Paul J., and Zsuzsanna Csereklyei. 2016. “Understanding the Energy-GDP Elasticity: A Sectoral Approach.” Energy Economics 58: 199–210. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2016.07.004.\nCaron, Justin, and Thibault Fally. 2022. “Per Capita Income, Consumption Patterns, and CO2 Emissions.” Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists 9 (2): 235–71. https://doi.org/10.1086/716727.\nDimitropoulos, Alexandros, Walid Oueslati, and Christina Sintek.2018. “The Rebound Effect in Road Transport: A Meta-Analysis of Empirical Studies.” Energy Economics 75: 163–79. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2018.07.021.\nFriedlingstein, Pierre, Matthew W.

    "text": "3.4 Power sector models\nThe mitigation module has two models that can be used for the electricity sector: the elasticity-based model and the techno-economic (‘engineer’) model. The user can choose to use the elasticity, engineer model, or a simple average of the two models. We recommend the ‘average’ model for ‘off-the-shelf’ use of CPAT and the engineer model for more tailored usages and for non-marginal changes (like a high CO2 tax policy). Before presenting the two models, it is essential to note that by default, prices and generation costs are applied to both the techno-economic (‘engineer)’ and the elasticity-based power models. The main differences are as follows:\n\nThe ‘elasticity-based’ model uses marginal increases in fuel prices and price elasticities to determine the shares of each generation type. It is simple, transparently parameterized, easily explainable, and easily deployable in an Excel spreadsheet model used in previous versions of CPAT and IMF tools.\nThe ‘engineer model’ explicitly models the capacity of different generation types, with capacity16 expanding to meet desired power demand. Power demand is a function of (price and GDP) elasticities, GDP change and end-user (residential and commercial/industrial) power prices. End user prices are taken from actual data with net subsidies constant and generation costs and carbon prices passed on to the users in default settings. Expected future capacity factors are assumed to match historical capacity factors in the base year (actual capacity factors for coal and gas generation are based on variable cost). Transmission losses and net electricity imports are modeled as a fixed quantity of total generation according to the energy balance data.\nThe stock of assets in the power sector is governed by a stock-flow process of investment and retirement. Investment is a function of levelized cost, with a system penalty for the cost of integrating high levels of renewable penetration. The model allows the user to define a constraint on Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) scale up rate, reflecting a ‘linear’ type constraint. Additions to VRE additions are constrained to be a certain percentage of total generation (in gross additions, not net of retirements). Retirements are exponential (the reciprocal of the lifetime) except for coal, which has both scheduled retirement based on country data, plus early retirement if the variable cost of coal generation (including carbon prices) exceeds the total cost of renewable-with-storage alternative (with quantities respecting the VRE scale-up constraint).\nDecisions changing the use of assets for power generation (dispatch) are also modelled, with renewables and nuclear dispatching ‘always run’ according to fixed capacity factors. Flexible capacity (gas and coal) is dispatched according to marginal price, to meet the residual power demand after always-run options, with a sigmoidal function of relative price. There is only one time period per year and a factor rewarding gas for increased flexibility is fitted to the historical data.\nThe model is consistent with countries’ generation capacities and makes it possible to investigate the radically different power systems consistent with high carbon prices, while the empirical ‘elasticity-based’ model is valid only for more marginal changes.\n\nIn what follows, Section 3.4.1 defines power prices and generation costs, Section 3.4.2 describes the techno-economic model, and Section 3.4.3 the elasticity-based model. Finally, Section 3.4.4 presents the parameter choices of the power models.\n\n3.4.1 Power prices and generation costs\nThis section describes the determination of generation costs and power prices in CPAT. These prices and generation costs are applied to the techno-economic (‘engineer)’ and the elasticity-based power models. However, in the latter case, the user has an alternative option to use a simpler set of prices based on the original IMF board paper, which are not covered here.\n\n3.4.1.1 Overview\nPower generation costs have the following components:\n\nVariable (per kWh) operations and maintenance costs;\nFixed (per MW) operations and maintenance costs;\nDecommissioning and waste disposal costs;\nFuel cost before the introduction of the carbon pricing policy;\nExisting or new renewables subsidies;\nExisting or new carbon price or other policy (feebate, excise duty on electricity); and\nSystems cost of integration, modeled as short+long-term storage costs as a function of variable renewable energy (VRE; meaning wind+solar+other renewables, but not including hydro or biomass) share.\n\nIn addition, we impose an implicit price of coal relative to gas, reflecting unobserved environmental regulations on coal and the superior flexibility of gas. These aspects are not fully captured in a model as simple as this. We calibrate this price on observed coal shares and future (IEA) projections (see Section 3.4.2.4).\nEnd-user (industrial and residential) power prices additionally have the following components:\n\nEstimated transmission and distribution costs (different for industry and residential);\nNet historical subsidy or tax (estimated either via a price gap or via independent data if provided by the user);\nAny correction for under- or over-estimated transmission and distribution costs (exists only if we have concrete subsidy data);\nNew carbon tax as imposed on the generation types and passed on to the end user; and\nAny electricity excise or rebate of the carbon price (Feebates/Output-based-rebating).\n\n\n\n3.4.1.2 Notation\nThe tables below present the notations used in the section and the name of the variables to which they correspond.

For example, one part is forward-looking expectations of future fuel and carbon costs.\nCost-recovery generation cost: For estimating the total running cost of the power system, a cost-recovery generation cost is estimated. This includes current variable cost, running amortization of capital costs, plus average interest costs (and other components too). The cost-recovery generation cost by generation type is averaged and then transmission and distribution costs added to produce an overall estimate cost of generating and distributing electricity.\nEnd user power prices (residential and industrial): these are based on observed prices with an adjustment for changes due to cost changes or carbon pricing. The user can decide what proportion of changes to overall generation cost are passed on. The user can also choose to phase out estimated electricity subsidy.\n\n\n\n3.4.1.4 Concept 1: Current variable costs\nVariable costs are used in the dispatch decision directly between gas and coal.17\nCurrent variable costs are defined as the sum of the following cost components:\n\\(vc_{\\text{ocft}} = \\text{vo}p_{\\text{ocft}} + fc_{\\text{ocft}} + ip_{\\text{cft}} = \\text{vo}p_{\\text{ocft}} + \\frac{p_{\\text{ocft}}}{\\nu_{\\text{cf}}} + ip_{\\text{cft}}\\)\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\text{vop}\\) represents variable costs for operating and maintenance, that is variable OpEx in USD per kWh.\n\\(\\text{fc}\\) denotes projected unit fuel costs before the introduction of the carbon pricing policy. These costs are calculated as the ratio of pre-tax prices (including producer-side subsidies) \\(\\text{ps}\\) and thermal efficiency \\(\\nu\\): \\(\\frac{ps_{\\text{cft}}}{\\nu_{\\text{cf}}}\\). It is worth noting that no improvements in time is currently modeled. By default, fuel costs are considered as a moving average over a 5-year window. The option to use spot prices can be enabled in the dashboard:\n\n\n\n\nDashboard: Use Spot Fuel Prices in Engineer Power Model\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{ip}c_{\\text{cft}}\\) denotes an implicit price component for coal. Note that this latter component could be turned off in the settings and not taken into account (for more information, see Section 3.4.2.4).\n\n\n\n3.4.1.5 Concept 2: Levelized costs of generation (Forward-looking)\n\n3.4.1.5.1 General approach\n\nLCOEs by generation type are estimated as a forward-looking (discounted cashflow) approach.\nNote these is different from the cost-recovery prices above as the cost-recovery approach uses an amortization of capital costs and running interest costs rather than discounting.\nFuel and carbon costs in these LCOEs are forward-looking, meaning they are the discounted value of future cashflows assuming full confidence in the proposed policy and full foresight.\n\nForward-looking generation costs are defined using a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) methodology, which relies on discounting at the appropriate discount rate. Levelized cost enables the comparison of different energy technologies with different characteristics (operating lifetime, capacity factor, construction cost, and time) on an equivalent basis. To the levelized cost, we add system integration costs. The levelized cost can be defined, in general, as the discounted sum of costs divided by the discounted sum of electricity produced. Let’s assume that a generation technology produces power for \\(N\\) years, and we start counting at year zero (so there are \\(N\\) payments, with the first being \\(t_{0}\\) and last being \\(t = N - 1\\). We separate the components \\(q\\) (capital cost) of the levelized costs, which can be treated equivalently. For each component \\(q\\) of the levelized cost:\n\\(\\text{LCO}E_{q} = \\frac{PV_{q}}{\\text{dem}} = \\frac{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{q,t}e^{- \\text{rt}}}{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}}\\)\nwhere \\(PV_{q}\\) is the present value of costs, \\(\\text{dem}\\) is the discounted power produced, \\(g_{t}\\) is the power produced at time \\(t\\) and \\(C_{q,t}\\) is the \\(q\\) component of costs at time \\(t\\), breaking down into the following components:\nThe full investment cost contains the following components:\n\nCapital expenditure\nDecommissioning (all generation types) and waste disposal cost (nuclear only)\nVariable OpEx\nFixed OpEx\nFuel Cost Before Carbon Price\nMarginal system cost of storage (see Section 3.4.2.5)\nCarbon Price\nImplicit cost of coal\n\nEach of these components is calculated using the levelized cost formula above. Almost all components are either fixed or increasing/decreasing at a fixed rate. In that case we can use a geometric series approximation. See the appendices for a derivation.\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is by default income-dependent:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Level\n\n\nWACC Assumed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIC\n\n\n0.075\n\n\n\n\nUMIC\n\n\n0.100\n\n\n\n\nLMIC\n\n\n0.125\n\n\n\n\nLIC\n\n\n0.150\n\n\n\n\nThe WACC can also be technology-dependent, i.e. it can be specified for each technology. At the same time, the WACC can be specified for the baseline and the policy scenario. Finally, the WACC can be defined globally by the user.\nThe levelized total investment costs is defined as:\n\\(\\text{ti}c_{P,\\text{cf}} = \\frac{vc_{P,\\text{cft}}*cf_{\\text{cf}}*\\text{df}c_{\\text{cft}}}{cf_{\\text{cf}}*\\text{df}c_{\\text{cft}}} + \\text{fi}x_{\\text{cft}}^{\\text{fl}}\\)\nwhere \\(\\text{df}c_{\\text{cft}}\\) is the discount factor \\(1 + \\text{wac}c_{\\text{cft}}^{t - t_{0}}\\) and \\(\\text{fi}x^{\\text{fl}}\\) denotes the forward-looking levelized fixed costs, which is calculated as:\n\\(\\text{fi}x_{\\text{cft}}^{\\text{fl}} = \\frac{\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}}{cf_{\\text{cf}}*365*24*\\text{dl}f_{\\text{cft}}} + \\frac{\\text{dt}c_{\\text{cft}}}{cf_{\\text{cf}}*365*24*\\text{dl}f_{\\text{cft}}} + \\text{st}o_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{op}f_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{pusRe}n_{\\text{cft}} + tmc_{fct}\\)\nwhere \\(\\text{cax}\\) is the capital cost, \\(\\text{dtc}\\) is th decommissioning total cost, \\(\\text{sto}\\) is the cost of storage, \\(\\text{fro}\\) correspond to fixed costs for operating and maintenance, \\(\\text{dl}f_{\\text{cft}}\\) denoting the discounted lifetime of each generation type \\(f\\), \\(\\text{re}s_{\\text{cft}}\\) reflects the per-unit renewable subsidies (if added), and \\(tmc_{fct}\\) the levelized transmission costs.\nThe Levelised Transmission Costs can be taken to a defined percentage in the dashboard:\n\n\n\nDashboard: percentage of transmission costs\n\n\nIn the dashboard, the following option allows the user to specify renewable subsidy under a baseline and policy scenarios:\n\n\n\nDashboard: Renewable subsidy ($/kwh in nominal terms)\n\n\nAfter the introduction of the carbon pricing policy, the current total cost is:\n\\(\\text{LCO}E_{P,\\text{cft}} = vc_{P,\\text{cft}} + \\text{fi}x_{\\text{cft}}^{\\text{fl}}\\)\nwhere \\(vc_{P,\\text{cft}} = vc_{B,\\text{cft}} + \\text{nc}p_{\\text{cft}}\\).\n\n\n3.4.1.5.2 LCOE methodology: Simplification\nAs mentioned in the main text:\n\\(\\text{LCO}E_{q} = \\frac{PV_{q}}{g} = \\frac{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{q,t}e^{- \\text{rt}}}{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}}\\)\nwhere \\(PV_{q}\\) is the present value of costs, \\(g\\) is the discounted power produced, \\(g_{t}\\) is the power produced at time \\(t\\) and \\(C_{q,t}\\) is the \\(q\\) component of costs at time \\(t\\), breaking down into various components described in the above section.\nThere is a simplification in the case of constant growth rates. If at and after time \\(n\\) the residual components of the cashflow have consistent real (logarithmic) growth rate \\(\\tau\\), i.e., \\(C_{t} = C_{n}e^{g\\left( t - n \\right)}\\), then they form a geometric series, which can be summed analytically:\n\\(\\begin{matrix} \\text{PVofCosts} & = \\sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}} + \\sum_{t = n}^{N - 1}C_{n}e^{- \\text{rn}}\\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{t - n} & & & \\\\ \\end{matrix}\\)\n\\(= \\sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}} + C_{n}e^{- \\text{rn}}\\sum_{t = n}^{N - 1}\\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{t - n}\\)\n\\(= \\sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}} + C_{n}e^{- \\text{rn}}\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - n - 1}\\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{t}\\)\n\\(= \\sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}} + C_{n}e^{- \\text{rn}}\\frac{1 - \\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{N - n}}{1 - \\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)}\\)\nIf a component is fixed in time, i.e. \\(\\tau = 0\\) and \\(n = 0\\), there’s a further simplification:\n\\(\\text{PVofCosts} = C_{n}e^{- \\text{rn}}\\frac{1 - \\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{N - n}}{1 - \\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)} = C_{0}\\frac{1 - e^{- \\text{rN}}}{1 - e^{- r}}\\)\n\\(\\begin{matrix} \\text{LCOE} & = \\frac{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}}{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}} & = \\frac{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{0}e^{\\text{τt}}e^{- \\text{rt}}}{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}} & = \\frac{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{0}\\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{t}}{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}} & = \\frac{C_{0}\\frac{1 - e^{- \\text{rN}}}{1 - e^{- r}}}{g_{0}\\frac{1 - e^{- \\text{rN}}}{1 - e^{- r}}} & = \\frac{C_{0}}{g_{0}} \\\\ \\end{matrix}\\)\n\n\n\n3.4.1.6 Concept 3: Cost-recovery estimated total cost of generation\n\nGeneration costs are modeled by component (CapEx, OpEx, Fuel costs etc). These are ‘cost recovery prices’ assuming amortization of CapEx, interest costs and so on.\nWeighted average generation costs are then augmented by global assumptions on transmission costs, to give estimated cost recovery price.\nThen the cost recovery price is compared to observed prices and the difference attributed to being a tax or subsidy (if no independent subsidy data is available) or an under/overestimated cost if independent (user entered) subsidy-data is available.\nFor cost recovery, a weighted average CapEx of the capital stock is needed. For most generation types, the CapEx per MW is constant, but for renewable energies it declines rapidly so the weighted average invested amount per MW is estimated by taking a weighted average of the current running total with the cost of new additions.\n\nThe current generation cost before tax, \\(\\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{cft}}\\), is thus composed of both variable and fixed costs:\n\\(\\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{cft}} = vc_{B,\\text{cft}} + \\text{fi}x_{\\text{cft}}\\)\nwhere \\(\\text{vc}\\) denotes current variable costs (defined in an earlier section) and \\(\\text{fix}\\) denotes amortized fixed costs.\nAmortized fixed cost is the sum of the following elements:\n\\(\\text{fi}x_{B,\\text{cft}} = \\text{ac}c_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{in}t_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{de}c_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{st}o_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{op}f_{\\text{cft}}\\)\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\text{acc}\\) is the yearly amortization of capital costs per kWh produced: \\(\\frac{\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}^{\\text{av}}}{\\text{cf}*365*24*\\text{li}f_{f}}\\) with \\(\\text{ca}x^{\\text{av}}\\) the weighted average CapEx, \\(\\text{cf}\\) the assumed capacity factor and \\(\\text{lif}\\) the lifetime for each fuel. The weighted average CapEx is defined as: \\(\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cf},t - 1}^{\\text{av}}*\\left( 1 - \\Phi_{\\text{inv}} \\right) + \\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}*\\Phi_{\\text{inv}}\\) with \\(\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}\\) the CapEx and \\(\\Phi_{\\text{inv}}\\) the new investment expressed as a proportion of total existing capacity less retirements. It is worth noting that the base year, \\(t_{0}\\), corresponds to \\(\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}\\). Over time, the CapEx is not varying, except for renewables (for more information see Section 3.4.4.4).\n\\(\\text{int}\\) is the interest costs per kWh produced, assuming a straight-line amortization of CapEx: \\(0.5*\\frac{\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}^{\\text{av}}*\\text{wac}c_{\\text{cf}}}{cf_{\\text{cf}}*365*24}\\) where \\(\\text{wacc}\\) is the WACC. The WACC can be adjusted according to different settings and both under a baseline and policy scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nDashboard: WACC Settings\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{dec}\\) denotes the yearly amortization of decommissioning costs18 per kWh produced: \\(\\frac{\\text{dt}c_{B,\\text{cft}}}{cf_{B,\\text{cf}}*365*24*\\text{li}f_{f}}\\) where \\(\\text{dt}c_{\\text{cft}}\\) denotes the decommissioning and transmission costs in USD per kW (for more information see Section 3.4.4.4).\n\\(\\text{sto}\\) defines the weighted average storage cost of vintages, which corresponds to the marginal storage costs for renewable energies.\nFinally, \\(\\text{opf}\\) represents fixed costs for operating and maintenance, that is fixed OpEx expressed in USD per kWh according to the capacity factor of each fuel: \\(\\frac{\\text{tf}c_{\\text{cft}}}{365*24*cf_{\\text{cf}}}\\) where \\(\\text{tfc}\\) is the fixed OpEx expressed in USD per kWy.\n\n\n\n3.4.1.7 Concept 4: End-user prices\n\nEnd-user prices are taken to be equal to current prices plus any change in underlying generation cost.\nObserved power prices are used as the basis of the demand model.\nChanges in generation costs (including those caused by carbon prices and any due to the phase-out of aforementioned subsidies) are assumed to be passed on to consumers (the proportion of pass-on defaults to 100% but can be altered.). If the parameter setting price controls is set to not one (could be 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) then all price changes (from technology changes or carbon price) are diminished in the same proportion.\n\nTo estimate power prices (i.e. before the policy tax is introduced), the weighted current generation cost is calculated as follows:\n\\(\\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{ct}}^{\\text{av}} = \\sum_{f}^{}gns_{B,\\text{cft}}*\\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{cft}}\\)\nFor each country, the weighted average of generation cost \\(\\text{gn}c_{B,c}^{\\text{av}}\\) is calculated according to generation shares \\(\\text{gn}s_{B,\\text{cft}}\\) of each fuel \\(f\\) and their respective current generation cost \\(\\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{cf}}\\).\nIn the engineer model, power prices are processed specifically in the residential and non-residential sector (i.e. industrial sector). The supply price in the technoeconomic model \\(sp_{B,\\text{cg}}^{T}\\) (where the index \\(T\\) holds for technoeconomic model) is determined in the residential and industrial sectors (\\(g = \\text{Residential},\\text{Industrial}\\)) via a fixed positive increment corresponding to transmission cost (\\(\\text{tmc}\\)) to the weighted average generation cost such as:\n\\(sp_{B,\\text{cg}}^{T} = \\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{ct}}^{\\text{av}} + \\text{tmc}\\)\nAn allowance of $15/MWh and $40/MWh was added to account for transmission and distribution costs for industrial and residential uses, respectively19.\nA markup \\(\\text{mu}\\) is then calculated specifically for residential and industrial electricity prices to equalize the starting year price (i.e. historical retail prices in the electricity sector, \\(\\text{hr}p_{\\text{cg}}\\)), as follows:\n\\(mu_{B,\\text{cgt}}^{T} = \\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{ct}}^{\\text{av}} + \\text{tmc} - \\text{hr}p_{\\text{cg}}.\\)\nIt is worth noting that when the markup is negative (i.e. retail prices are lower than modeled supply prices), the model captures a subsidy.\nCarbon taxes are applied at the fuel-input stage to each generation. However, for the purposes of the overall generation cost, those costs are excluded as part of the generation cost average and averaged, and added on, separately. This is for the reason that doing this way allows us to calculate easily a needed rebate when rebating is employed.\nThe final residential and industrial end user power price in the technoeconomic power model, \\(p_{P,\\text{cg}}^{T}\\), is calculated as follows when a carbon price, \\(\\text{nc}p_{\\text{cg}}\\), power excise, \\(\\text{pe}x_{P,\\text{cgt}}\\), a rebate, \\(\\text{re}b_{\\text{cg}}\\), are introduced:\n\\(p_{P,\\text{cgt}}^{T} = \\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{ct}}^{\\text{av}} + \\text{nc}p_{\\text{cgt}} - \\text{re}b_{P,\\text{cgt}} + \\text{pe}x_{P,\\text{cgt}} + \\text{tmc} + mu_{B,\\text{cgt}}^{T}\\)\nAt this stage two end-user power price settings are included:\n\nOutput Based Rebating: the total carbon price is added to the generation types and then subtracted from overall power prices so that the overall policy is revenue-neutral.\nElectricity Excise: a per-kwh tax is added at the end-user stage\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Techno-economic (‘engineer’) power model\n\n3.4.2.1 Overview\nElectricity is widely acknowledged to be critical to ‘deep decarbonization’ scenarios, in the sense that alternatives such as renewables primarily generate electricity instead of solid, liquid, or gaseous energy vectors. Deep decarbonization involves decarbonizing the existing power sector and electrifying sectors that currently use fossil fuels directly. Electrification will also involve expanding the power sector to accommodate the increased power demand from this shift in energy vector. Such a structural model is important for the following reasons:\n\nMarginal versus radical. Elasticity-based models are arguably best suited to price-based demand-side effects of marginal increases in fuel prices. They are less well suited to the non-marginal changes required for deep-decarbonization Paris-compliant scenarios.\nWithin bounds of equipment. Power systems involve two significant sets of decisions: decisions that change the stock of power generation assets (investment and retirement) and decisions that change the use of those assets for electricity generation (dispatch). Without determining the capital stock, it is unclear that a particular choice of generation is consistent with the actual generation capacities of a specific country. An elasticity-based approach can produce non-physically realistic results (i.e., power dispatched that requires implicit investment rates faster than what is realistic).\nResponsiveness to absolute levels of renewable costs. Elasticity-based models can be unresponsive to actual levels of costs since it is based principally on the changes in cost.\nUsing accurate, referenced generation cost data. The elasticity-based model used data that was at times not clearly referenced and not recently updated. For example, the percentage of non-fuel costs in total coal generation costs seems inconsistent between the spreadsheet and the published IMF paper. Neither are directly referenced against currently published costs.\nRenewables costs are rapidly changing, and it is helpful to model this explicitly.\nThe model should include, and the outcomes depend on, carbon price-dependent switching carbon prices for generation and investment. It’s helpful to know the ‘switching cost’ (for example, between coal and gas) in terms of the dispatch decision and the investment decision as a valuable marker of required carbon taxes to begin decarbonization.\nModeling the new reality. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data, newly built renewables have already achieved cost-parity with newly built fossil fuel plants in many parts of the world. Consequently, the near future is likely to look very different from the past, even without any policy-led acceleration of the deployment of renewables. Indeed, the recent deployment of renewables has tended to surprise on the upside (e.g., actual deployment has tended to outpace IEA projections). It’s unclear whether an elasticity-based model can fully capture these rapidly changing dynamics.\n\nSummary of algorithm\nAs mentioned previously, the model has four types of prices:\n\nCurrent Variable Costs: For dispatch decisions, the current variable costs are used (fuel and variable operations and maintenance).\nLevelized Cost of Investment: For forward-looking (investment) decisions, a levelized and forward-looking cost approach adding all cost components is used. For example, one part is forward-looking expectations of future fuel and carbon costs.\nCost-recovery generation cost: For estimating the total running cost of the power system, a cost-recovery generation cost is calculated. This includes current variable cost, running amortization of capital costs, plus average interest costs (and other components too). The cost-recovery generation cost by generation type is averaged and then transmission and distribution costs are added to produce an overall estimated cost of generating and distributing electricity.\nEnd user power prices (residential and industrial): these are based on observed prices with an adjustment for changes due to cost changes or carbon pricing. The user can decide what proportion of changes to overall generation cost are passed on. The user can also choose to phase out the estimated electricity subsidy.\n\nThe outlines of the algorithm are as follows:\n\nEnd-user prices and GDP changes drive power demand by CPAT sector. (Some components of these prices are lagged one year to avoid circularity as Excel uses sequential rather than optimizing logic.)\nAccording to historical energy balance data, transmission losses, own use, and net exports are added as fixed proportions of aggregated power demand.\nCurrent inflexible capacity (renewable, nuclear) are assumed to dispatch at historical capacity factors, and the remainder is allocated to coal and gas according to available capacity using a logit formula based on variable cost.\nOld capacity is retired according to either to defined data on retirement schedules (coal) or an exponential process (other generation types), with cost-based early retirement also included and an option to schedule retirement of coal.\nAggregate new generation capacity is added to meet expected demand assuming historical capacity factors.\nRenewables are assumed to require both short- and long-duration storage, with assumed piecewise-quadratic total storage requirements, implying piecewise-linear marginal storage requirements. These storage requirements are approximately modelled based on global technical models. These storage costs are added to generation costs for Variable Renewable generation types.\nNeeded additions to aggregate ‘effective’ capacity (i.e. additions to expected generation) are then allocated according to another logit formalism based on total levelized costs by generation type, with the cheapest generation types taking the main share of the investment.\nRenewables also have a maximum scale-up rate, set by default to 2 percentage points of total generation for wind and solar additional-generation. This setting can be changed by the user. Needed capacity beyond the limits are reallocated to other generation types according to the logit proportions. If there is still an unmet need for generation (for example in a high-hydro situation where new hydro investment is prohibited), the model will in extremis override VRE scaleup limits and the allowed investment types and invest in proportion to the current proportions of capacity in the system.\nCapacities after retirement and new investment are passed forward as the starting point of the model for the next year.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.16: Techno-economic (‘engineer’) power model diagram\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2.2 Notation\nThe table below presents the notations used in the section and the name of the variables to which they correspond.

At present, our power demand is determined the same way as the equations outlined in Section 3.3.3, with fuel type equal to power (electricity) (\\(f = P\\)):\n\\(\\frac{E_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{E_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha_{\\text{sf}}} \\right)^{1 + \\epsilon_{U,\\text{sf}}}\\Psi_{\\text{ct}}\\left( \\frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{G,\\text{csf}}}\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}}}\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{F,\\text{csf}}\\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}} \\right)}\\)\nwhere \\(E\\) is expressed in ktoe, \\(Y\\) is the total real GDP, \\(\\alpha\\), the autonomous annual energy efficiency improvement. The prices \\(p\\) correspond to total (industrial and residential) power prices, as in Section 3.3.3). These prices respond to changes in weighted total generation cost, which is lagged by one year to avoid circularity issue.\nA Covid adjustment factor to power demand \\(\\Psi\\) can be taken into account (see Section 3.3.4.4 - note this is specifically calibrated for the engineer model). Note that additional policies affecting the parameter \\(\\alpha\\) can be manually added.\nThat power demand from the elasticity model can also be used (it is very similar, just not disaggregated by sector):\n\n\n\nMitigation: Use Elasticity Model Power Demand In Engineer Model\n\n\nThe total generation requirement (in ktoe), \\(g_{\\text{oc},t}\\), is therefore calculated as the sum of the total demand of all sectors augmented (subtracted) by the proportion – based on the base year – of net exports (imports), \\(\\text{ne}t_{\\text{oc},t_{0}}\\), the energy industry’s own use, \\(\\text{ei}u_{\\text{oc},t_{0}}\\), and transmission and statistical differences, \\(\\Delta_{t_{0}}^{\\text{dif}}\\):\n\\(g_{\\text{oc},t} = \\sum_{s}^{}E_{\\text{ocs},t}*\\left( 1 + \\text{ne}t_{\\text{oc},t_{0}} + \\text{ei}u_{c,t_{0}} + \\Delta_{c,t_{0}}^{\\text{dif}} \\right)\\)\n\n\n3.4.2.4 Power supply\n\n3.4.2.4.1 Logit function\nTwo different cost-based decisions are considered in the engineer model: the dispatch decision, determining how existing power plants are used, and new investment planning. In both of these decisions, the ‘multilogit’ function is used, with the probability of investment and dispatch of a technology increasing as a function of the price differential with alternatives. A parameter \\(K\\) adjusts the shape of the sigmoidal function that can be refined upon review of leading power sector models employing a similar approach. They determine the speed of transitioning between generation types with a different cost. The \\(K\\) parameters are set with defaults set subjectively at 2 for both dispatch and investment, which we believe produces realistic results. This parameter can be adjusted in the dashboard:\n\n\n\nDashboard: K parameters\n\n\nThe formula of the multilogit is as follows:\n\\(\\frac{x_{\\text{ocft}}}{\\sum_{f}^{}x_{\\text{ocft}}} = \\frac{e^{- K.c}}{\\sum_{i}^{}e^{- K.c}}\\)\nwhere \\(\\frac{x_{\\text{ocft}}}{\\sum_{f}^{}x_{\\text{ocft}}}\\) is the proportion (i.e. investment, \\(x = \\text{inv}\\), or generation \\(x = \\text{gen}\\)) allocated to generation type \\(f\\), and \\(c_{i}\\) is the relative cost of generation type \\(f\\) (i.e. the total levelized cost of electricity in the case of investment or variable costs \\(i\\).\n\n\n3.4.2.4.2 Dispatch decision\nDispatch decisions are based on a multi-step process.\nThe model first determines generation from nuclear, renewables, biomass and oil according to their capacity factor and the total supply required. In particular, renewables are assumed to produce power according to their installed capacity multiplied by historical capacity factors.\nIn the case of renewables, they are assumed to be non-dispatchable meaning their capacity factor is fixed. For nuclear, the low variable cost makes it economical always to run the plant when available. For biomass and oil, we simplify as we do not wish to model merit order decisions with many different fact (hourly peaking needs, environmental regulations etc).\nThen, residual energy demand is determined by an explicit choice between coal and gas based on the variable cost of each (including the carbon tax). In other words, the remaining generation needed after nuclear, renewables, biomass and oil generation are subtracted, is allocated to coal and gas.\n\\(\\text{reqge}n_{\\text{oc},\\text{COA} + \\text{GAS},t} = g_{\\text{oc},t} - \\sum_{\\text{fϵ}\\left( \\text{RE},\\text{NUC} \\right)}^{}cap_{f}*cf_{f}\\)\nFirst, we determine the minimum coal needed assuming gas runs at maximum capacity and vice versa for coal. The maximum capacity is by default set to 90%, but the user can adjust it in the dashboard:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.17: Dashboard: Use energy balances or (CPAT) energy consumption data\n\n\nFor example, for coal:\n\\(\\text{minge}n_{\\text{oc},\\text{COA},t} = \\text{reqge}n_{\\text{oc},\\text{COAL} + \\text{GAS},t} - \\text{ca}p_{\\text{GAS}}*\\text{maxC}f_{\\text{GAS}}\\)\nThen, the remaining required generation after these minima are allocated to coal and natural gas, \\(g_{f}\\), is determined based on their relative marginal costs, using the logit formulation:\n\\(\\lambda_{f} = \\frac{e^{- K_{\\text{dispatch}}.H_{f}}}{\\sum_{f}^{}e^{- K_{\\text{dispatch}}.H_{f}}}\\)\nwhere \\(f\\) is restricted to coal or natural gas and \\(\\lambda_{f}\\) is the proportion of the residual generation (after the ‘minimum coal’ and minimum gas’ allocation given limited capacity of the other) allocated to each of coal and gas. The term \\(H_{g}\\) is the ratio \\(\\frac{vc_{P,\\text{cft}}}{vc_{P,\\text{cft}}^{\\text{lc}}}\\), where the (marginal) variable cost is given by \\(vc_{P,\\text{cft}}\\) and \\(vc_{P,\\text{cft}}^{\\text{lc}}\\) is the variable cost of the lowest cost option between coal and natural gas, i.e. \\(f \\in \\left\\{ \\text{coal},\\text{naturalgas} \\right\\}\\), and \\(K_{g}\\) is the K parameter specific to generation.\nPower generation for coal thus becomes:\n\\(g_{\\text{oc},\\text{COA},t} = \\text{minge}n_{\\text{oc},\\text{COA},t} + \\lambda_{f}*\\text{residualreqge}n_{\\text{oc},\\frac{\\text{COA}}{\\text{GAS}},t}\\)\nwhere \\(\\text{residualreqgen}\\) denotes the residual power generation from coal and gas.\nThis procedure gives overall raw generation shares (assuming no PPAs), \\({\\widetilde{\\gamma}}_{\\text{ocf},t}\\). It is worth noting that to the extent PPAs exist, a fixed capacity factor is used. Therefore, the latter is downscaled if the ‘needed’ coal and gas generation is less than what is implied by their default capacity factors. The total generation mix becomes:\n\\(\\gamma_{\\text{ocf},t} = \\left( 1 - \\omega_{\\text{oct}} \\right)*{\\widetilde{\\gamma}}_{\\text{ocf},t} + \\omega_{\\text{oct}}*\\Omega*\\left( \\text{ca}p_{\\text{ocft}}*CF_{\\text{cft}} \\right)\\)\nwhere \\(\\gamma_{\\text{ocf},t}\\) is the generation share after PPAs \\(\\omega\\) denotes the percentage PPAs and \\(\\Omega\\) a downscaling factor if needed generation is different from that which is determined by the raw capacity factors.\n\n\n3.4.2.4.3 Retirement and capacity needed\nAt the start of the analysis, the capital stock is based on electricity generation capacity data by fuel type from Enerdata. Required effective capacity is equal to expected generation capacity and is defined as capacity multiplied by the expected capacity factor — i.e., the investment is set such that the capacity is sufficient to cover expected peak demand, which is estimated using the power demand equation (see Section 3.4.1.2).\nThe economic system is expected to plan ahead a few years in advance so that investment takes place to meet the projected demand at the start of each year at the same time as retirement is modeled to happen. Capacity for the first year is thus determined based on IEA data.\nFor the following years, new capacity is thus equal to the old capacity, less retirements, and plus any new investments needed. The total required generation capacity is given by the expected power demand minus the generation capacity (last year’s capacity less retirements):\n\\(g_{\\text{ocft}} = g_{\\text{ocf},t - 1} - \\sum_{f}^{}ret_{ocf,t - 1} + inv_{ofc,t - 1}\\)\nIt is assumed that a generation dependent proportion, \\(\\text{ret}\\), of all generation assets retire each year, equal to the reciprocal of the average lifetime \\(\\text{lif}\\) of that generation type.\n\\(\\text{re}t_{\\text{ocft}} = \\frac{1}{\\text{lif}}*\\text{ca}p_{\\text{ocft}}\\)\nFor coal, it is worth noting that planned retirement is adjusted based on the coal power plant tracker, which provides power plant data level for a number of countries. Therefore, based on these data, the retirement year of each power plant is determined and the capacity associated is determined from 2022 to 205020. When data do not exist, the above formula is used.\nIn addition to planned retirement, cost-based early retirement coal is also estimated as additional policies could accelerate retirement for coal power plants. In this respect, the model:\n\nFirst finds the maximum of coal that could be replaced by wind and solar. The maximum coal retirement is estimated as a fixed proportion (default 80%) of coal total effective capacity.\nSecond, it compares the variable cost of coal with the total cost of wind and solar.\nThird, it calculates through a logit formula a proportion of the maximum coal replacement (depending on relative costs):\n\n\\[\n\\text{re}p_{\\text{oc},\\text{coa},t} = 1 - \\frac{e^{- K_{i}.H_{r,\\text{COA}}}}{\\sum_{f}^{}e^{- K_{i}.H_{r,f}}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(H_{r,\\text{coa}}\\) is the ratio \\(\\frac{vc_{\\text{oc},\\text{coa},t}}{vc_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{lc}}}\\) and \\(H_{r,f}\\) is the ratio \\(\\frac{vc_{\\text{ocft}}}{vc_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{lc}}}\\) with \\(f \\in \\left\\{ \\text{coal},\\text{solar},\\text{wind} \\right\\}\\). The term \\(\\text{re}p_{\\text{oc},\\text{COA},t}\\) denotes the proportion of coal replacement.\nIn order to phase out coal only when coal prices are above renewables costs, we added a weighted indicator function to the logit formula.\nFinally, the estimated proportion \\(\\text{re}p_{c,\\text{coa},t}\\) is multiplied by the maximum of coal retirement.\nTherefore, the total retirement is equal to the sum of planned retirement and cost-based early retirement.\n\n\n3.4.2.4.4 Investment decision and non-VRE and VRE scale up limitations\nInvestment decisions are constrained by non-VRE and VRE limits and are based on two rounds:\n\nNew investments permitted: A logit function capped by a VRE limit that spreads out investments across technologies based on the cheapest levelized costs.\nAllocated remaining capacity needed: A least-cost merit order algorithm allocates remaining capacity needed according to generation costs across technologies.\n\nLogit function constrained by scale-up limits\n\n\nSimilarly as dispatch and retirement, new investment is spread out across the cheapest levelized possibilities, according to a multilogit formulation (with K parameter = 2):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{iv}p_{\\text{ocft}}}{\\sum_{f}^{}{\\text{iv}p_{\\text{ocft}}}} = \\zeta_{\\text{cft}}*\\frac{e^{- K_{i}.H_{i}}}{\\sum_{i}^{}e^{- K_{i}.H_{i}}}\n\\]\nWhere: \\(\\zeta_{\\text{cft}}\\) stands for new investments permitted in percentage. The user has the possibility to enable new investments (in MW). \\(\\text{iv}p_{\\text{cft}}\\) denotes the proportion of new investments \\(K_{i}\\) the K parameter specific to investment decisions. The term \\(H_{i}\\) is the ratio \\(\\frac{\\text{ti}c_{P,\\text{cft}}}{\\text{ti}c_{P,\\text{cft}}^{\\text{lc}}}\\), \\(\\text{ti}c_{P,\\text{cft}}\\) and \\(\\text{ti}c_{P,\\text{cft}}^{\\text{lc}}\\) define, respectively, the levelized investment cost and the lowest levelized investment cost across fuel types. It is important to note that renewables face a penalty at high levels (i.e., above 75% penetration) as an additional ‘storage systems cost’ could increase costs (see Section 3.4.2.5 on Long-term storage).\nDifferent options are possible for whether new investments are permitted (\\(iv^{\\text{new}}\\)):\n\nIf present is the default option and allows new investments in the model if nameplate capacity > 0. Otherwise, no investment is accounted for.\nYes allows the user to introduced planned investments, that is specifying a start year.\nNo disables new investments.\nManual allows the user to enter data. These data will override the data determined by the model and new capacity will be accounted for as: New Nameplate Investments (MW) = Capacity data entered by the user + Planned Retirement.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.18: Dashboard: Plan or enable new investment\n\n\nMaximum effective investments, \\(\\text{iv}^{\\max},\\) are then capped by non-VRE and VRE limits (\\(\\text{VRE}\\)):\n\\[\n{\\text{iv}_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\max} = g}_{\\text{oc},t}*\\zeta_{\\text{cft}}*VRE_{\\text{cft}}\n\\]\nDefault non-VRE limits are set to 5% for coal and natural gas and 2% for hydro, oil, other renewables, nuclear and biomass. Default VRE limits are set to 2% (i.e. for wind and solar).\nCPAT allows the user to define non-VRE and VRE scale up rates. The rates reflect a ‘linear’ type constraint. It constrains generation in VRE additions to be a certain percentage of total generation (in gross additions, not net of retirements). For VRE rates, the following rates can be selected: Low (1%), Medium (2%), High (3%), Very High (4%), UserDefined and CountrySpecific (currently set to 2% – except for China 2.5%). The default is country specific.\n \n\n\n\nFigure 3.19: Dashboard: Scale up rate specification for wind and solar\n\n\n\nLeast-cost merit order\n\nThe logit approach and the scale-up limitation determines ‘allocated’ investment. But there is still some needed investment that is not allocated. We use a least cost merit order approach to determine the currently ‘unallocated’ investment need.\nThe least cost algorithm ranks the generation types in terms of the cost and then use up all their available space (within the capacity limits) one by one, starting with the cheapest and so on.\nFirst of all, the algorithm defines the remaining unallocated investment need. New effective investment before reallocation are defined as the minimum between maximum effective investments and new investments permitted in order to make sure investments cannot be superior to the maximum capacity. Therefore, this allows to determine the remaining investments needed, \\(iv^{\\text{rem}}\\):\n\\[\n{iv_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{rem}} = \\ iv}_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\max} - \\min{(\\text{iv}_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\max},\\text{iv}_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{new}})}\n\\]\nSecond, generation costs are ranked from the cheapest to the most onerous across technologies in order to allocate remaining capacity needed.\nThird, remaining capacity are thus allocated in a second round of investment according to the cheapest technology in a cumulative way.\nFinally, total new investments equals investments permitted over the two rounds of investments, that is before reallocation and after reallocation:\n\\[\niv^{\\text{tot}} = \\text{iv}_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{new}} + \\ iv_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{rem}}\n\\]\n\n\n3.4.2.4.5 Calibration and systems costs\nTwo calibrations are performed in the engineer power model, that is (1) a calibration on the total electricity generation and (2) an inferred value for systems cost, calibrated on the share of coal.\nFirst, to ensure proper calibration of the engineer power model in 2020, a COVID adjustment factor can be used to calibrate total electricity generation. The latter, estimated by the model, is compared to observed data (IEA, 2020). The adjustment factor is calculated as the percentage difference between the estimated and observed data. Results per country can be found in the tab ‘CovidAdjust’. For countries not covered by the IEA database, the factor adjustment is similar to the Covid adjustment on energy consumption (see Section 3.3.4.4). Importantly, in 2021, a rebound effect is introduced.\nBy default, the adjustment factor is set to 0. However, the user can rely on the adjustment factor by modifying the setting to 1 (see below). It should be mentioned that the lower and upper limits are set at 25%, which means that the factor adjustment cannot be less (more) than -25% (25%).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.20: Dashboard: Covid Adjustment\n\n\nSecond, systems costs are currently inferred by using a calibration on the share of coal in the electricity generation. This exercise is carried out using observed data in 2019 based on observed data from the IEA and consists of matching observed data for the coal share in the electricity generation. Systerms costs are equivalent to an additional implicit price for coal, \\(\\text{im}p_{c,\\text{coa},t}\\). Inferred value for system costs are thus used for the years after 2019, with the exception of the year 2020. The latter is considered as exceptional because of the Covid shock. Therefore, the exercise is repeated for this year, as systems costs could be higher. IEA’s forecasts on the share of coal in total electricity generation for the year 2030 are also reported for information only.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.21: Dashboard: Covid Adjustment\n\n\nFor the years 2019 and 2020, the following steps are taken:\n\nThe share of coal in total electricity generation is calculated for both the power model’s estimates and observed data from the IEA.\nTo account for the difference between these two values, the “goal seek difference” is expressed as the following distance between estimated and observed coal share: \\(\\left( \\text{co}a_{t}^{\\text{est}} - \\text{co}a_{t}^{\\text{obs}} \\right)^{2}\\), where \\(\\text{coa}l_{t}^{\\text{est}}\\) denotes the share of coal estimated by the power model and \\(\\text{coa}l_{t}^{\\text{obs}}\\) represents the observed share of coal for \\(t \\in \\left\\{ 2019,2020 \\right\\}\\).\nAs estimated coal share is often over-estimated compared to observed data, the goal seek difference is thus addressed by increasing prices for coal (i.e. an implicit price component) in order to reduce the difference between estimated and observed coal share. Only positive implicit price components are considered.\n\nResults of additional implicit prices are reported in the tab ‘GoalSeekCoal’ for both 2019 and 2020. By default, CPAT uses the additional implicit prices. However, an option in the dashboard allows the user to turn this assumption off or to manually add the implicit price component.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.22: Dashboard: Coal share calibration\n\n\nIf the “Manual” option is selected, the user overrides the implicit price component with their choice.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.23: Dashboard: Coal share calibration (manual)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2.5 Storage decision\nCPAT has a simple model of electricity storage. The required storage consists of two elements, short and long-term. Both long and short-term storage is related to the proportion of renewable energy (VRE) generation as a percentage of total electricity generation. VRE includes wind and solar and other renewables but not hydro and biomass.\nBecause the model does not represent renewable energy generation profiles, relative quantification of balancing capabilities, or variability in demand, a “system integration cost” is imposed on higher shares of variable renewable energy (VRE). This cost is assumed to be an increasing function of VRE share. This additional cost forms part of the investment decision. The cost of integrating renewables is particularly significant at high levels (i.e. >50% by generation) of renewable penetration into an electricity mix. Against this background, two different types of storage are considered in the model:\n\nShort-term storage, which are costly per kWh but cheap per kW (e.g. batteries measured in kWh).\nLong-term storage, which are costly per kW but cheap per kWh (e.g. electrolysis and hydrogen tanks measured in kW).\n\nFor both types of storage there is an additional ‘hours’ ratio, measuring the ratio of battery capacity (kwh) to battery interface (kw), and electrolysers (kw) to hydrogen storage (kwh). Each storage aspect is two-dimensional, meaning that every storage technology is determined by an ‘interface’ (kW) and a ‘storage quantity’ (kWh). The model measures storage according to one ‘numeraire’ and one ratio. For short-term storage, we measure the kWh and assume a standard 4-hour ratio between the kWh and kW in determining the costs. We calculate the kW for long-term storage and assume 1000 hours of storage per kW.\n\n3.4.2.5.1 Short-term storage\nShort-term storage in CPAT is satisfied by the batteries. Total storage needs are calculated in hours, which means kWh of storage per kW of average generation (not peak capacity).\nThe model uses rounded versions of a parameterization derived from global data (Bogdanov et al. (2019)). The model assumes that the total number of storage for a 100% VRE system is 9 hours, with a quadratic form. We fit the short-term storage needed (in hours) as a (conservative) quadratic function of the VRE. We allocate some percentage of this (currently 100%) to the costs of the power system itself. VRE, \\(v\\), includes solar and wind but not hydro (other renewables are neglected). Short-term storage \\(\\text{sst}\\) is measured in hours, i.e. kWh/(kWh/h). We also assume a ratio between the kWh of the storage and the kw interface. For conservatism (given our metric is in kWh), we use a low number (2 hours) for the ratio of kWh to kw:\n\\(\\text{sst} = 9v^{2}\\)\n\\[\n\\text{sst} = 9v^{2}\n\\]\nBy way of example, for a 50% VRE system, the hours needed are \\(9*{0.5}^{2} = 2.25\\) hours.\nTherefore, the marginal storage needed is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{dsst}}{\\text{dv}} = 18v^{2}\n\\]\nThe system has assumed to already have invested optimally in the existing storage at current VRE.\n\n\n3.4.2.5.2 Long-term storage\nCPAT also has a long-term storage model. Long-term storage is additional to short-term storage and is measured according to the cost of the interface (i.e., the electrolyzers rather than the cost of the storage tank). The interface is measured in units of KW. Therefore the proportion of long-term storage per kW of average generation is measured in dimensionless terms (kW per kW or %).\nLong term storage \\(\\text{slt}\\) costs are treated as effectively punitively costly (in contrast to short term storage), reflecting current costs and technological uncertainties. The long-term storage model assumes zero need for long-term storage below a VRE penetration of 75 percent, raising to 100 percent at a VRE of 100 percent. To this end, long-term storage is viewed as additional to short-term storage, and is needed for VRE over 75%.\nSince batteries and hydrogen have other uses, we also have a parameter that determines the proportion of the short-term and long-term storage allocated to the electricity system. This is set to 100% for short-term storage and 33% for long-term storage. This parameter can be modified in the dashboard:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.24: Dashboard: Percent allocation of LT storage costs to VRE\n\n\nGiven its interseasonal storage and geographic independence, we focus on the costs of electrolysers for storage. This storage cost is thus assumed as a long-term storage and is measured with the interface (i.e. electrolysers) as the numeraire. It is given by the following quadratic function:\n\\[\n\\text{slt} =\n\\begin{cases}\n    0 & \\text{for } v \\leq 0.75 \\\\\n    \\left(\\frac{v-0.75}{1-0.75}\\right)^2 & \\text{for } v > 0.75 \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nLong term storage requirements are measured in MW/MW, i.e. dimensionless units (%). The marginal MW of electrolysers required once VRE penetration reaches 75% is thus varying according to the derivative \\(2*\\frac{v - 0.75}{\\left( 1 - 0.75 \\right)^{2}}\\). The table below shows the results for different levels of VRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVRE penetration\n\n\nMarginal MW of electrolyzers required\n\n\n\n\n\n\n85%\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n90%\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n\n\n95%\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n\n\n100%\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2.5.3 Levelized cost of storage\nThe levelized cost of the marginal quantity of storage needed to maintain required quantities of total storage is added to the investment costs for VRE. This means that the storage-inclusive cost of renewables can rise in time as renewable penetrations increase, even if the cost of renewables without storage is falling.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Elasticity model\n\n3.4.3.1 Overview\nThe elasticity-based model is derived from an IMF spreadsheet tool, with a methodology described in IMF (2019). The CPAT mitigation module, and the IMF tool on which it is based, are primarily elasticity-based models, meaning that future fuel demand is dependent on projected total real GDP growth, and upon future energy prices, modified by mitigation policies such as carbon taxes. The power supply model is also based on elasticities, although it has a more complex structure than in other sectors. It separately models final power demand, and within that overall power demand the generation share of different generation types.\n\n\n3.4.3.2 Notation\nThe table below presents the notations used in the section and the name of the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are reported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made to ensure that they match our calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\nVariable\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(E\\)\nTotal quantity of power demanded by sector\nGWh\n\n\n\\(Y\\)\nTotal real GDP\nUS$\n\n\n\\(p\\)\nRetail price\nUS$/Gj\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\)\nAutonomous annual energy efficiency improvement\n%\n\n\n\\(\\Psi\\)\nCovid adjustment factor to energy demand\n%\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{Y}\\)\nForward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel demand\n%\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{U}\\)\nElasticity of usage of energy products and services\n%\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{F}\\)\nEfficiency price elasticity\n%\n\n\n\\(g\\)\nelectricity generation\nGWh\n\n\n\\(\\Phi\\)\nProduction share\n%\n\n\n\\(\\text{gn}c^{*}\\)\nTotal unit cost adjusted of thermal efficiency\nUS$/kWh\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}}\\)\nConditional own-price elasticity of generation from fuel \\(f\\) with respect to generation cost\n%\n\n\n\\(\\delta^{\\text{add}}\\)\nAdditional share of electricity generation attributed to non-nuclear and non-hydro energy\n%\n\n\n\\(\\text{TotExcess}\\)\nTotal surplus of nuclear and hydro power generation to be redistributed\n%\n\n\n\\(F\\)\nUse of fuel\nktoe\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3.3 Generation costs\nImportantly, by default, the power generation costs are taken from the engineer model (i.e. levelized fixed cost plus current variable costs, but excluding intangible coal cost). However, this assumption can be modified and the cost model from the IMF board paper can, if wished, be selected in the dashboard. The methodology for these ‘old’ costs is given the IMF paper mentioned above.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.25: Dashboard: Use old or new generation costs in elasticity model\n\n\nRenewable producer subsidies under a baseline scenario, as well as under the policy scenario, can be specified in the dashboard:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.26: Dashboard: Renewable producer subsidies under a baseline scenario\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3.4 Total power demand\nAs described above, power demand is determined by the energy use equation. As this is a total power demand, elasticities are averaged across all sectors. The autonomous efficiency improvements (or more especially, the annual generation productivity improvements) used across fuels are as follows:\n\n\n\nFuels\nChange\n\n\n\n\nCoal\n0.5%\n\n\nNatural gas\n1.0%\n\n\nOil\n0.5%\n\n\nNuclear\n1.0%\n\n\nWind\n5.0%\n\n\nSolar\n5.0%\n\n\nHydro\n1.0%\n\n\nOther renewables\n5.0%\n\n\nBiomass\n1.0%\n\n\n\nProductivity improvements at power plants reflect improvements in technical efficiency and gradual retirement of older, less efficient plants. Following the IMF Board Paper, for coal, annual average productivity growth is taken to be 0.5 percent based on IEA’s data. For natural gas, nuclear, and hydro, there is likely a bit more room for productivity improvements and baseline annual growth rate of 1 percent is assumed. For renewables, a productivity growth rate of 5 percent is used (i.e., costs halve every 15 years).\nFor the base year, energy consumption is extracted from energy balances, expressed as total energy consumption net of fuel transformation and transportation. The index \\(E\\) denotes the sector Electricity.\nFor 2020, estimates are based on the previous year’s data adjusted for a one-time exogenous shock, i.e., Covid (see Section 3.3.4.4).\n\\[\n\\frac{E_{\\text{oct}}}{E_{\\text{oc},t - 1}} = \\left( 1 + \\alpha \\right)^{- \\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U} \\right)}\\left( 1 + 0.5*\\Psi_{\\text{ct}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{cEt}}}{p_{\\text{cE},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{U,\\text{cE}}}\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{cEt}}}{p_{\\text{cE},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{F,\\text{cE}}}\\left( \\frac{Y_{\\text{ct}}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{G,\\text{cE}}}\n\\]\nIn the elasticity model, half the usual Covid adjustment is employed as power demand does not fall as far as other energy types.\n\n\n3.4.3.5 Total power supply\nPower generation fuels potentially include coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, biomass wind, solar and other renewables.\nSimilar to the engineer model, total demand is scaled to generation (which includes additionally transmission losses, energy industry own use and transmission losses). The total production of electricity, \\(g_{\\text{oct}}\\), is driven by the total power demand multiplied by the ratio of generation to demand in the base year.\n\\[\ng_{\\text{oct}} = E_{\\text{oct}}*\\frac{g_{\\text{oc},t_{0}}}{E_{\\text{oc},t_{0}}}\n\\]\nFor the base year, total electricity generation is based on observed energy balance data, which is the sum of all electricity generation from each fuel \\(f\\).\nThe elasticity model provides two types of information when it comes to forecast generation of each type of fuel: the electricity output and the primary energy used for electricity production for each technology.\nThe electricity output from technology \\(f\\) is defined as the production share multiplied the total production. The production share, \\(\\Phi_{\\text{ocft}}\\) is derived from observed data and is defined as the ratio between the observed electricity output from fuel \\(f\\) and the total production, that is \\(\\frac{g_{\\text{ocft}}}{g_{\\text{oct}}}\\). The production share is assumed to be fixed until 2020. After this date, to accommodate flexible assumptions for the degree of substitution among fuels, the share of fuel \\(f\\) in generation is defined as:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{\\text{ocft}} = \\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}\\left( \\frac{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}}} + \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}\\sum_{i \\neq f}^{}\\left\\lbrack 1 - \\frac{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocit}}^{*}}{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{oci},t - 1}^{*}} \\right\\rbrack^{\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}}}}{\\sum_{j \\neq f}^{}\\Phi_{\\text{ocj},t - 1}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are bound variables ranging over the same range as \\(f\\) (i.e., OIL, NGA, COA, NUC, WND, SOL, BIO, REN, HYD). In addition, \\(\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocft}}^{*}\\) denotes the total unit cost adjusted of thermal efficiency and \\(\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}} < 0\\) is the conditional own-price elasticity of generation from fuel \\(f\\) with respect to generation cost. Conditional (indicated by \\(\\\\tilde\\)) here means the elasticity reflects the percent reduction in use of fuel \\(f\\) due to switching from that fuel to other generation fuels, per one-percent increase in generation cost for fuel \\(f\\), holding total electricity generation fixed. Generation cost elasticities are larger than corresponding fuel price elasticities as an incremental increase in fuel and non-fuel generation costs has a bigger impact than an incremental increase in fuel costs alone.\nFrom the above equation, fuel \\(f\\)’s generation share decreases in own generation cost. It also increases in the generation cost of fuel \\(i \\neq f\\), where the increase in fuel \\(f\\)’s generation share is the reduced share fuel \\(i\\) (i.e., \\(\\Phi_{\\text{ocft}}\\) times the term in square brackets) multiplied by the (initial) share of fuel \\(f\\) in generation from all fuel alternatives to \\(i\\) (i.e., \\(\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}}{\\sum_{f \\neq i}^{}\\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}}\\):\nNB: The actual equation in CPAT also reflects that nuclear and hydro should normally not grow beyond current levels. Therefore the model reallocates any excess growth for nuclear and hydro to other generation types. The equation above thus becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{\\text{ocft}} = \\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}\\left( \\frac{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}}} + \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}\\sum_{f \\neq i}^{}\\left\\lbrack 1 - \\iota_{\\text{cft}} \\right\\rbrack^{\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}}}}{\\sum_{f \\neq i}^{}\\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}}*\\delta^{\\text{add}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\iota_{\\text{cft}} = \\frac{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}}\\) and \\(\\delta_{\\text{oct}}^{\\text{add}} = \\frac{\\text{TotExces}s_{\\text{oc},\\text{NUC} + \\text{HYD},t}}{\\left( 1 - \\Phi_{\\text{oc},\\text{HYD},t} - \\Phi_{\\text{oc},\\text{NUC},t} \\right)}\\)\nThe energy used of each technology \\(f\\) in electricity production\nSimilarly, to electricity output, the base year corresponds to observed data, with the exception of wind, hydropower, solar and other renewables which are equal to electricity output. Therefore, for the following years, the energy used in electricity production is expressed as follows:\n\\[\nF_{\\text{ocft}} = E_{\\text{ocft}}*\\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha_{f}} \\right)^{t}\\frac{F_{\\text{ocf},0}}{E_{\\text{ocf},0}}\n\\]\nThe fuel use is equal to the electricity generated multiplied by an efficiency improvement over time \\(\\alpha_{f}\\) specific to the generation type \\(f\\).\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Power data sources and parameter choices\n\n3.4.4.1 Overview\n\n3.4.4.1.1 Sources\nThe section presents the data sources and the methodology to estimate the different characteristics of the power sector. In particular, is it first important to present the data and explain how consistency is ensured across the different data sources. The remainder of the section focuses on the methodology employed to estimate the power sector characteristics.\nIn the mitigation module, and in particular in the power sector, CPAT relies on several characteristics presented in the section below, along with their definition.\nThe table below presents the different data sources used to estimate power plant characteristics.\nTable 3‑7: Power characteristics and data sources\n\n\n\nFigure 3.27: Data mapping and description of data sources\n\n\nAs presented above, CPAT relies on various data sources which provide project-based data, that is:\n\nStefanides (2021): The IRENA Renewable Cost Database contains cost and performance data for around 17 000 renewable power generation projects across the world with a total capacity of more than 1,770 GW.\nLorenczik et al. (2020): The database covers 243 plants in 24 countries.\nEIA (EIA, 2021): Data were collected on the status of existing electric generating plants and projects scheduled for initial commercial operation within 5 or 10 years in the United States and Puerto Rico.\nEnerdata: The tool provides data power generation assets in around 150 countries throughout the world based on 7800 operating projects or projects under development.\nZucker (2018): Based on confidential, project-based European data from 2015, the authors provide forecast estimates of investment costs.\nBogdanov et al. (2019): This study bases its global estimations on various above-mentioned sources. In particular, the authors rely mainly on IEA&NEA for renewable data and BNEF for non-renewable data to forecast some characteristics. The authors provide data for the years 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045 and 2050.\nNREL: Cole, Frazier, and Augustine (2021) and Augustine and Blair (2021) provide historical as well as forecast data for utility-scale battery storage costs in the United-States. The former article’s data and estimates are based on a survey of 18 studies, including sources mentioned above. Cole, Frazier, and Augustine (2021) update their work on a yearly basis. Cole, Frazier, and Augustine (2021) is the latest update. The latter study based their projection costs on BNEF data, which provide learning rates and deployment projections for utility-scale battery. Another advantage of relying on BNEF data lies in the provision of data on component of batteries.\n\n\n\n3.4.4.1.2 Data approach for the power prices and ‘Engineer’ power model\nThe power models have important data requirements. There are two main types of data sources: first (method one), we have components that are directly from, or derived from, energy consumption data and energy capacity data; second (method two), we have components that come from studies.\nTwo crucial quantities use a combination of data sources: thermal efficiency and capacity factor.\nMethod 1: Energy Consumption, capacity data, and derived data\nThere are three primary energy consumption datasets used: electricity generation (in GWh), by generation type, fuel use (in ktoe), and electrical capacity (in MW). Before beginning, all three energy sources are converted to a consistent unit, MW, equivalent to MWy per year.\nThermal efficiency is calculated thus:\n\\[\n\\nu_{\\text{cf}} = \\frac{g_{\\text{cf},t_{0}}}{F_{\\text{cEf},t_{0}}}\n\\]\nFor coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, and biomass, where \\(F_{\\text{ocEf},t_{0}}\\) is the fuel f used for the generation of electricity \\(g_{\\text{ocf},t_{0}}\\)21\\(,\\) in the base year, baseline scenario. For solar, wind, hydro, and other renewables, efficiency is set by convention to 1. As mentioned before, we use Net Calorific Values exclusively.\nIf efficiency is less than a certain level, currently set to be 10%, we use the best data from studies rather than derived efficiencies. Note the efficiencies are not ‘floored’ in this case but instead set to be equal to the study data.\nCapacity data are taken from EIA, except for fossil fuel types which are taken from the EIA all-fossil average and then descaled using estimated proportions calculated by CPAT from other sources.\nCapacity factors are derived in a similar way\n\\[\ncf_{\\text{cf}} = \\frac{g_{\\text{cf},t_{0}}}{\\text{ca}p_{\\text{cf},t_{0}}}\n\\]\nThese data are used in CPAT unless they are outside specific ranges set in the dashboard.\nMethod 2: Components derived from studies\nTo compute cost, specific disaggregated prices and other components (e.g., lifetime) data by technology and sometimes by country are used. Input data are derived as averages of EIA, IEA & NEA, IRENA, JRC (EU), Bodganov, et al., and NREL data.\nThese averages are made by country, region and world, with selected study data chosen by country, region then world according to data availability. Note that the asia region does not include China, Japan and (South) Korea, because of widely different costs compared to the regional average.\nThe table below provides an overview of the different sources, methodology unit and coverage for each data type employed in the engineer power model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData section\nMethodology\nUnit\nData level\nData source\n\n\n\n\nMain parameters\nSimple averages of available data points are computed. In the first stage, in order not to overweight one data source over another, the averages are calculated by data source, as a data source may provide different data at a given time and for the same technology because data are project-based. In a second step, the calculation of averages is deployed in the following order of priority: by country, by CPAT region, and globally.\nCapEx, variable and fixed OpEx are in USD/kW\nGlobal\nIRENA; IEA&NEA; EIA; Enerdata; JRC; Bogdanov et al. (2019); NREL\n\n\n\n\nCapacity Factor, WACC ad efficiency are in percentage\nRegional\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal lifetime is in years\nCountry\n\n\n\nEvolution of CapEx\nIn the case of wind and solar, we use the learning curve method to forecast global CAPEX from 2023 to 2050. We use capacity projections from the IEA Stated Policy (STEPS) and Net Zero (NZE) scenarios, then experience Parameters extracted from Way et al., 2022 . Following the work of JRC (see Ioannis Tsiropoulos, Dalius Tarvydas, and Andreas Zucker 2018), the learning curve method to forecast CAPEX for renewable energies other than wind and solar from 2023 to 2040 is applied to each CPAT region, China, Japan, Korea and worldwide. The other technologies, i.e. coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear, are not subject to a learning rate nor to different scenarios and are assumed to be constant over time.\nIndex (base year: 2019)\nGlobal\nEnerdate, IEA, Way et al. 2022, IRENA, Breyer, JRC and NREL\n\n\n\n\n\nRegional\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry: China, Japan, Korea\n\n\n\nDecommissioning & Transmission costs\nDecommissioning and transmission costs are based on estimates provided by several data sources.

Overnight cost designates the cost of a construction project if no interest rates are incurred during the construction time.\nIn the power sector, thermal efficiency (or heat rate) expresses the fraction of heat that becomes useful work. In other words, the amount of energy input that is transformed into work output can be computed through the thermal efficiency: \\(\\varphi = \\frac{W}{Q_{I}}\\). Thermal efficiency is comprised between 0 and 100%. For instance, if 200 joules of thermal energy are input (\\(Q_{I}\\)), and the engine transforms this energy into 80 joules, the efficiency rate is 40%. In the United-States, the heat rate is widely spread and is expressed in British Thermal Units (BTU). One BTU is equivalent to roughly 1055 joules and 2.93E-4 kWh.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.28: Data mapping and description of data sources\n\n\nThere are two ways of calculating thermal efficiency, that is in net or gross calorific value. Calorific value is an essential parameter to specify the energetic content of different materials. Net calorific value (or low heating value) subtracts the heat of vaporization of the water from the gross calorific value, while the gross calorific value (or high heating value) is the total amount of heat produced from the complete combustion of a unit of a substance. It is essential to verify whether the efficiency is net or gross because the difference can be about 5% to 6% of the gross value for solid and liquid fuels, and about 10% for natural gas.\nFor instance, in a gas power plant, let’s say that to produce 1kWh of electricity, 3kWh of natural gas in gross calorific value (GCV) is necessary. The net calorific value (NCV) can be derived from the gross calorific value by using a factor of 0.9 (Eurostat et al., 2004). Consequently, in NCV, 2.7kWh are necessary to produce 1kWh. The thermal efficiency is therefore equivalent to \\(\\frac{1}{3} = 33\\%\\) in GCV and \\(\\frac{1}{2.7} = 37\\%\\) in NCV or, equivalently, the thermal efficiency in GVC corresponds to the thermal efficiency in NVC to which the conversion rate is applied: \\(37\\% \\times 0.9 = 33\\%\\). The conversion rate fluctuates with the fuel used but also the technology used. Finally, the heat rate is often expressed in British thermal units (BTU) per net kWh generated. To express the efficiency of a generator or power plant as a percentage, it is essential to divide the equivalent BTU content of a kWh of electricity (3,412 BTU) by the heat rate.\nThe capacity factor measures the frequency of operation of a power plant during a given period. It is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the unit’s actual power output by the maximum possible output. This ratio indicates how much of a unit’s capacity is being used.\n\n\n3.4.4.3 Consistency across data sources\nThe simple average of the data sources is used to construct our dataset of electricity sector characteristics. Nevertheless, faced with different approaches, we first analyze the underlying assumptions of each data source and performed a few adjustments to build a consistent approach. The table below outlines the different assumptions underlying the construction of variables in the power sector according to various data sources and correction is CPAT. Green cells indicates that no adjustments have been made, whereas orange cells provide adjustments made in CPAT. As the study of Bogdanov et al. (2019) is based on the data sources listed in the table, it is not incorporated in the table.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.29: Assumption underlying the construction of power data\n\n\nAs the various data sources rely on disparate assumptions under a few aspects, adjustments are made to build a consistent database to be fed into CPAT. As such, the following adjustments are performed.\nCosts in time: The latest version of CPAT relies on data in 2019. As costs in time may vary depending on status of the power plant (e.g. operational, under construction, authorized, etc.), the retained approach first aims at building time series based on the available data points in time across the different data sources. Longest time series span from 1983 to 2040. While all sources focus on operational power plants or in the pipeline for commissioning after 2019, Enerdata considers a multitude of statuses, including cancelled or announced projects. Therefore, we filter the status of the plants and select only plants that are operational until 2020. From 2021 to 2040, only announced and authorized projects, power plants under construction and PPA signed are considered in the construction of time series. In the case of Bogdanov et al. (2019), which provide data every five years (i.e. starting from 2015), estimates for the year 2019 are approximated using the following weighting approach: \\(\\text{CAPE}X_{2019} = 0.2 \\times \\text{CAPE}X_{2015} + 0.8 \\times \\text{CAPE}X_{2020}\\).\nOvernight costs: Capital costs are in principle excluding interest payments during construction time. However, IRENA Renewable Cost database provides total installed costs, namely including overnight costs. To adjust data from overnight costs, two information are needed:\n\nThe construction time (\\(n_{\\text{cons}}\\)) data for each renewable technology. This information is derived from both EIA and IEA&NEA. The average of the two sources of information is used as in the table below.\nThe weighted average cost of capital (wacc). Following Steffen (2020), the WACC is roughly 7.5% for OECD countries and 10% for non-OECD countries. We thus apply the following rates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Level\n\n\nWACC Assumed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIC\n\n\n7.5%\n\n\n\n\nUMIC\n\n\n10.0%\n\n\n\n\nLMIC\n\n\n12.5%\n\n\n\n\nLIC\n\n\n15.0%\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the following formula is used to subtract overnight costs: \\(\\frac{\\text{CapE}x_{\\text{IRENA}}}{\\left( 1 + \\text{wacc} \\right)_{\\text{cons}}^{n}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\nAverage time (year) for construction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomass\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\n\nSolar (Utility-scale PV)\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\nGeothermal power\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\nHydropower\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\nOn-shore wind\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\nCosts are in USD and real (i.e. net of inflation): Only BNEF database displays nominal data. Monetary data are thus adjusted based on the US GDP deflator indicator. In the case of JRC and Breyer, data are real but denominated in EUR. The 2019 average EUR/US exchange rate is applied.\nEfficiency in Net Calorific Value: The differences between net and gross calorific values are typically about 5% to 6% of the gross value for solid and liquid fuels, and about 10% for natural gas. Therefore, based on the original (GCV) data from BNEF, we approximate the NCV by applying a 10% increase for natural gas and 5.5% for the other technologies considered on the GCV values.\nLifetime assumptions: Lifetime information is given for all types of technologies considered in CPAT except for biomass. A lifetime of 35 years for power plants specialized in biomass is supposed.\n\n\n3.4.4.4 Estimation of the power sector characteristics\nTo estimate power sector characteristics in 2019, simple averages of available data points are computed. In the first stage, in order not to overweight one data source over another, the averages are calculated by data source, as a data source may provide different data at a given time and for the same technology because data are project-based. In a second step, the calculation of averages is deployed in the following order of priority: by country, by CPAT region22, and globally. More specifically, to construct a dataset for the year 2019:\n\nCapEx is estimated based on 2019 data points only; 2019 is retained as a commissioning year for power plants.\nFor Fixed and Variable OpEx, Efficiency and Capacity Factor, due to data limitation, closest trends are included (i.e. the average includes estimates for plants commissioning between 2015 and 2025). This approach is reasonable because these variables do not vary greatly from year to year.\n\nForecasting CAPEX:\nFrom 2020 to 2022\nEvidence over the recent years shows a surge in international metals and minerals prices. As renewable technologies are more metals and minerals than non-renewables (Boer, Pescatori, and Stuermer (2021)23), rising metals/minerals costs can be expected to increase the relative cost of new renewables investment. Projected capital expenditure costs for investment in new renewable and non-renewable capacity were therefore upscaled. Metals and all other commodities are expected to increase by about 2 times in 2022-324 compared to 2020 levels and assuming that these primary inputs into renewables account for roughly one tenth of the total of renewables up-front investment costs, which are themselves about 75% of total costs for renewables (Hirth and Steckel (2016)), the increase of CapEx for renewables would be about 15% in 2022-3 compared to 2020. However, as a part of this increase might be captured in 2020-1 historical data, the CapEx increase in new renewable and non-renewable capacity was upscaled by 10% and 5% in 2022 respectively.\nFrom 2023 onwards\nAmong renewable energies, solar and wind are subject to the highest learning rate. Consequently, the learning rate approach is applied to these two technologies, while others, i.e. coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear, and other renewables, are not subject to a learning rate nor to different scenarios and are assumed to be constant over time, i.e. after 2023.\nThe learning rate method is commonly employed to estimate development of costs over time and holds the advantage of being relatively easy to measure. With specific learning rate to technologies, this approach indicates the price reduction of the considered technology (i.e. the performance indicator) arising from every doubling of cumulative installed capacity (experience rate). Experience does not cause costs to drop directly. While it is believed to be correlated to changes in the production process (e.g. R&D, technical innovation, economies of scale or labor productivity) or the product itself (e.g. design), the model does not identify the factor of cost reduction. More sophisticated models include component-based learning costs, multi-factor learning curves (Rubin et al. (2015)) or an approach based on probabilistic cost forecasting methods (Way et al. (2022)).\nCost reduction in time, accounting for the performance and experience indicators, is expressed by:\n\\(\\text{Cos}t_{t} = \\text{Cos}t_{0}\\left( \\frac{\\text{Ca}p_{t}}{\\text{Ca}p_{0}} \\right)^{\\left( - \\varepsilon \\right)}\\)\nwhere \\(\\text{Cos}t_{t}\\) is the unit cost of the considered technology in year \\(t\\) after the deployment of cumulative installed capacity of \\(\\text{Ca}p_{t}\\) unit. Similarly, \\(\\text{Cos}t_{0}\\) stands for CapEx in year 0 at cumulative deployment capacity of \\(\\text{Ca}p_{0}\\) unit. \\(\\varepsilon\\) denotes the experience parameter. The learning rate (\\(\\text{LR}\\)) is thus:\n\\(\\text{LR} = 1 - 2^{\\varepsilon}\\)\nwhere the parameter \\(2^{\\varepsilon}\\) is known as the learning rate ratio or progress ratio and reflects the slope of the learning curve.\nThe underlying idea is to highlight the cross-country transferability of a country’s learning effects. For wind and solar only, we use capacity projections from the IEA Stated Policy (STEPS)25 and Net Zero (NZE)26 scenarios, then experience Parameters extracted from Way et al. (2022).\nWe consider four different scenarios27:\n\nThe low scenario: we use the IEA STEPS scenario for capacity projections data, and a low learning rate parameter (equal to mean – standard deviation ; 0.276 for Solar, 0.153 for Wind)\nThe medium scenario: we use the IEA STEPS scenario for capacity projections data, and a medium learning rate parameter (0.319 for Solar, 0.194 for Wind)\nThe high scenario: we use the IEA NZE scenario for capacity projections data, and a medium learning rate parameter (0.319 for Solar, 0.194 for Wind)\nThe very high scenario: we use the IEA NZE scenario for capacity projections data, and a high learning rate parameter (equal to mean + standard deviation ; 0.362 for Solar, 0.235 for Wind)\n\nBelow are the capital expenditures projections for the case of solar energy, for all the four scenarios.\n\n\nStorage costs: Utility-scale battery storage systems differ slightly from other technologies as they store produced electricity by generators or pulled from the electric grid. These systems then redistribute the power based on the demands. It is worth noting that battery storage costs are commonly expressed in kWh, although one fraction of these costs, the power costs, are measured in kW. We follow Cole, Frazier, and Augustine (2021) and express the costs of battery as follows: \\(\\text{TotalCost}\\left( \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{kWh}} \\right) = \\text{EnergyCost}\\left( \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{kWh}} \\right) + \\text{PowerCost}\\left( \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{kW}} \\right)/(\\text{Duration}\\left( \\text{hr} \\right)\\)\nSeveral types of battery exist, typically varying from 1h to 4h storage battery. In CPAT, costs for battery correspond to 2h storage battery. Forecast storage costs are based on the work of Cole, Frazier, and Augustine (2021) and Augustine and Blair (2021)28. The authors base their estimations on current literature and data for Li-Ion Battery Storage, 60 MW, 240 MWh storage (4 hours) in the United-States are used as representative data. Costs for 2h storage battery are then estimated based on the above formula and expressed in kW29. In particular, all values are given in 2019 U.S. dollars, using the Consumer Price Index (BLS, 2020) for dollar year conversions. Projections use an inflation assumption of 2.5% per year. In the same vein as for wind and solar, three scenarios are developed. The low, middle and high scenarios correspond to the minimum, median and maximum points, respectively. Augustine and Blair (2021) follows the approach in Cole, Frazier, and Augustine (2021), where data points between 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2050 are derived from a linear interpolation.\nDecommissioning costs: Decommissioning takes place after a power plant retires. Notably, retirement and decommissioning are different. Retirement indicates that the plant is no longer producing electricity, but assets such as buildings, turbines, boilers or other equipment are left on site. The decommissioning process refers to dismantlement, environmental remediation and restoration of the site. While much of the literature focuses on decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants, data on decommissioning costs for other types of technology are scant. The following data sources are used in CPAT:\n\nRaimi (2017) provides estimates on decommissioning costs per type of technologies (offshore and onshore wind, coal, concentrated solar, solar PV and petroleum and gas) based on a survey of the literature. Data are expressed at 2016 U.S. dollar prices;\nNeri et al. (2016) presents data on nuclear power plant decommissioning costs based on surveys answered by nuclear power plants located in Europe. Data are expressed at 2013 U.S. dollar prices;\nDuke Energy Corporation30 is a nuclear power plant that submitted information to the US authority on the cost of decommissioning. Data are expressed at 2017 U.S. dollar prices; and\nWater Power & Dam construction31 estimates, based on information on dam destruction in the United-States, that decommissioning costs can be 20-40% of new construction costs.\n\nIn CPAT, decommissioning costs are expressed as a percentage of global upfront costs. To this purpose, for nuclear, estimates retrieved from these studies are averaged. The ratio of the available data for decommissioning costs to the global CapEx (US/MW) data by technology type, are then used to express decommissioning costs as a percentage of CapEx. For natural gas, the average between estimated decommissioning costs for petroleum and gas (various types) is used as decommissioning costs. For hydropower, based on the above-mentioned study, it is assumed that decommissioning costs amount to 20% of CapEx.\n\n\n3.4.4.5 References\n\nAndrade, J., & Baldick, R. (2017).

    "text": "3.5 Emissions\nThis section describes how GHG emissions estimation and emissions are accounted for in CPAT and how they are projected in each sector.\n\n3.5.1 Overview\nIn CPAT, emissions are projected in two ways: i) energy-related emissions are based on a model, that is estimations of energy consumption (see Section 3.3) in the different sectors are converted into GHG emissions by the means of an emission factor; and ii) non-energy related emissions are forecasted based on particular assumptions. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions are presented following the UNFCCC Inventory category, and scaled to the inventory’s base year. The table below summarizes the approach taken to forecast emissions forward.\nFor energy related emissions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPollutant\nAssumptions to forecast emissions\n\n\nCarbon dioxide (\\(CO_{2}\\))\nCorresponding emissions are calculated by multiplying energy consumption by emissions factors. The model starts from observed value for emissions.\n\n\nMethane (\\(CH_{4}\\))\nWe multiply a calibration factor (equal to the ratio of the 2019 energy-related methane emissions and the 2019 Global Warming Potential (GWP100) for methane emissions) by the GWP100 for methane emissions of the associated year.\n\n\nNitrous oxide (\\(N_{2}O\\))\nTotal energy-related nitrous oxide emissions are scaled to carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\nFluorinated gases (F-gases)\nF-gases emissions are historically equal to zero and are thus assumed to be equal to zero in the future.\n\n\n\nFor non-energy related emissions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmission type\nPollutant\nAssumptions to forecast emissions (in the case of forecasts based on a growth effect, GDP or population, we use specific sectorial elasticities)\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial emissions\n\\(CO_{2}\\), \\(CH_{4}\\), \\(N_{2}O\\), F-gases\nThe growth rate is based on changes in energy-related industrial \\(CO_{2}\\) emissions.\n\n\nAgricultural emissions\n\\(CO_{2}\\), \\(N_{2}O\\), F-gases\nNon-energy agriculture emissions are forecasted based on the GDP and population growths (and a proxy for additional mitigation efforts – if selected by the user). There is however a specific treatment for \\(CH_{4}\\) agricultural emissions.\n\n\nAgricultural emissions\n\\(CH_{4}\\)\n\\(CH_{4}\\) agricultural emissions are calculated by multiplying the agricultural production with the after abatement methane emission factor. Agricultural production is obtained by accounting for the GDP and population growth’s effect on the previous year’s production, and the associated change in oil producer prices caused by the methane fee. We then multiply this emission value with the Global Warming Potential of methane for non-fossil fuel emissions of the associated year.\n\n\nLand Use, Land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)\n\\(CO_{2}\\), \\(N_{2}O\\)\nForecasted non-energy \\(CO_{2}\\) and \\(N_{2}O\\) emissions for LULUCF are driven by a sink activity growth and the ratio of the growth in emissions for the carbon tax scenario to the increase in emissions for the baseline scenario (also called ‘additional mitigation effort’). However in the case of \\(N_{2}O\\) emissions, we also take into account the population growth effect.\n\n\nLand Use, Land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)\n\\(CH_{4}\\), F-gases\nForcasted non-energy \\(CH_{4}\\) and F-gases emissions for LULUCF are driven the growth in emissions for the carbon tax scenario to the increase in emissions for the baseline scenario (also called ‘additional mitigation effort’). However in the case of F-gases emissions, we also take into account the population growth effect.\n\n\nWaste and Other\n\\(CO_{2}\\), \\(N_{2}O\\), F-gases, \\(CH_{4}\\)for Other only\nFor waste and other emissions, forecasted estimates are determined by the population growth effect and the additional mitigation effort. Those factors multiply the previous year’s emissions value.\n\n\nWaste\n\\(CH_{4}\\)\n\\(CH_{4}\\) waste emissions are calculated by multiplying the waste production with the after abatement methane emission factor. Waste production is obtained by accounting for the GDP and population growth’s effect on the previous year’s production, and the associated change in oil producer prices caused by the methane fee. We then multiply this emission value with the Global Warming Potential of methane for non-fossil fuel emissions of the associated year.\n\n\n\nEmissions have two dimensions:\n\nPollutants: Carbon dioxide (\\(CO_{2}\\)), Methane (\\(CH_{4}\\)), Nitrous oxide (\\(N_{2}O\\)) and Fluorinated gases (F-gases). GHG emissions include those in the UNFCCC inventories (\\(CO_{2}\\), \\(CH_{4}\\), \\(N_{2}O\\) and Fluorinated Gases (or F-gases), including PFCs, HFCs SF6, and NF3). Note that the mitigation also presents short-lived air pollutants (PM2.5, NOx, SO2, CO2, NMVOC, BC, OC, CH4 and CO); the methodology for these is covered in the air pollution module documentation.\nSectors: Energy-related sectors (i.e., Transport, Power, Industry, Building, and Other energy use), as well as non-energy-related sectors (i.e., Agriculture, Industrial Process, LULUCF, Waste and Other). It is important to note that some parts of the sectors accounted for in the non-energy sectors are also reflected in energy-related sectors. For instance, Agriculture also appears under the ‘Building’ sector, under ‘Food and Forestry’ sub-sector (for more information, see Appendix B).\n\nCPAT considers territorial rather than consumption-based emissions. This means that, for example, if some natural gas is imported but subject to leaks upstream in extraction before it arrives at the country concerned, these methane emissions are not counted in the emissions of a natural gas power station. However, an extracting country will include those leaks. Similarly, the emissions from imported goods are not included, whereas those associated with exported goods are included.\nIn what follows, we first define the role of emission factors and their sources. Second, we present the approach adopted for energy-related\\(_{}\\) emissions by fuel and sector. Third, we describe the estimation of non-energy-related emissions in non-energy sectors. We use the index \\(p\\) to refer to the type of GHG (\\(CO_{2}\\), \\(CH_{4}\\), \\(N_{2}O\\) and F-gases). The variable \\(em_{\\text{ocupt}}\\) denotes the estimation of emissions under scenario \\(o\\), country \\(c\\), UNFCC sector \\(u\\) , and for pollutant \\(p\\) and at year \\(t\\). Total GHG emissions are the sum of both energy and non-energy related emissions: \\(em_{\\text{oc},\\text{GHG},t} = em_{\\text{ocER},\\text{GHG},t} + em_{\\text{ocNER},\\text{GHG},t}\\). Finally, the section explains how NDCs are accounted for in CPAT.\n\n\n3.5.2 Notation\nThe table below presents the notations used in the section and the name of the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are reported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made to ensure that they match our calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\nVariable\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{em}\\)\nEmissions\n\\(\\text{tC}O_{2}\\)/GJ\n\n\n\\(\\text{Δe}m_{\\text{LUCF},t}\\)\nLULUCF emissions decline\n% per annual in absolute value of start year\n\n\n\\(\\text{ef}\\)\nEmission factors\n\\(\\text{tC}O_{2}\\)/ktoe\n\n\n\\(F\\)\nUse of fuel\nktoe\n\n\n\\(\\text{fug}\\)\nMethane fugitive and venting emissions\n\\(\\text{tC}O_{2}\\)/ktoe\n\n\n\\(\\text{gwp}\\)\nGlobal warming potential from methane emissions\n\\(\\text{tC}O_{2}\\)/ktoe\n\n\n\\(red\\)\nPercentage of reduction of methane emission factor, due do abatement\n%\n\n\n\\(mf\\)\nMethane fee\n$/\\(tCH_{4}\\)\n\n\n\\(Y_{\\text{grow}}\\)\nGDP growth\n%\n\n\n\\(lp_{\\text{grow}}\\)\nPopulation growth\n%\n\n\n\\(\\text{ame}\\)\nAdditional (e.g. non-pricing) mitigation effort\n%\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{Y}\\)\nForward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel demand\n%\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{\\text{lp}}\\)\nPopulation elasticity\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Emission factors\nAn emission factor is a coefficient that converts activity data into GHG emissions. It represents the average emission rate for a given fuel relative to consumption units. For instance, in the power sector, coal emits 3.931 ton of \\(_{}\\) per ktoe.\nThe emission factors used are (as a default) fuel-, country- and sector-specific emissions from IIASA’s GAINS model32. The user also has the option to use global emissions factors from the IEA.33 The emission factors given by the IEA are scaled at a worldwide level, while those from IIASA are country specific. Also, IIASA emission factors include process and fugitive emissions in the distribution network from natural gas (which is why it is necessary to rescale them through the overall calibration to 2019 emissions). All emission factors are sector and fuel specific.\nThe user has the possibility in the dashboard to select the source of emission factors to be used. Global IEA emissions factors are also an option.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.30: Selection of the source of emission factors\n\n\nThe emissions are given originally in \\(\\frac{\\text{tC}O_{2}}{\\text{GJ}}\\), then converted in \\(\\frac{\\text{tC}O_{2}}{\\text{ktoe}}\\) via a \\(\\text{ktoe}\\) to \\(\\text{GJ}\\) conversion factor of \\(41,868\\).\n\\(ef_{\\text{cgf},\\frac{\\text{tC}O_{2}}{\\text{ktoe}}} = ef_{\\text{cgf},\\frac{\\text{tC}O_{2}}{\\text{GJ}}}*41,868\\)\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that we do not have data for emission factors for sector-fuel types when the energy consumption is close to zero. Therefore, the following rules are applied to define emission factors when missing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSector-Fuel types\nAssumptions\n\n\n\n\nPower sector-LPG\nEqual to emission factors in the industrial sector\n\n\nRoad-LPG\nEqual to emission factors in the building sector\n\n\nPower sector-Kerosene and Road-Kerosene\nEqual to emission factors in the building sector\n\n\nRoad-Coal\nEqual to emission factors in the power sector\n\n\nRoad-Other oil products\nEqual to emission factors for diesel\n\n\nAll sectors-Biomass\nEmission factors are equal to zero\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Energy-related emissions\nEnergy-related emissions are estimated across sectors and by aggregating sectors (i.e., Transport, Power, Industry, Building, and Other energy uses) for the four GHGs (i.e. \\(\\text{CO}_{2}\\), \\(CH_{4}\\), \\(N_{2}O\\) and F-gases). In this section, the index \\(u = E\\), denotes the energy-related sectors.\n\n3.5.4.1 Carbon dioxide (\\(CO_{2}\\))\nEnergy-related \\(CO_{2}\\) emissions are calculated by multiplying energy consumption by emissions factors. Emissions are multiplied by \\(10^{- 6}\\) as the emission factor \\(\\text{ef}\\) is given in tCO2e/ktoe and the fossil fuel consumption \\(F\\) is given in ktoe, to obtain emissions in mtCO2e. We neglect this unit transformation in the description below.\nIn 2019, these \\(CO_{2}\\) energy-related emissions are scaled to UNFCCC inventory emissions such that base-year emissions are equal in the model and the inventory. After 2019, these emissions are thus calculated, for each fuel \\(f\\) and for a year \\(t\\), as the multiplication of the fossil fuel’s consumption for year \\(t\\) by the sector’s associated to emission factor:\n\\(em_{\\text{ocEsfpt}} = F_{\\text{ocEsft}}*ef_{\\text{cEsfp}}\\)\nwhere \\(o\\) represents scenario, \\(s\\), sector, \\(f\\), fuel type, \\(p\\), GHG (e.g., \\(CO_{2}\\)) and \\(t\\) the year.\n\\(CO_{2}\\) emissions are determined across all fuels and across all sectors (and grouping sectors). Total energy emissions are determined as the sum across sectors and fuels (for energy related emissions u=E)\n\\(em_{\\text{ocpt}} = \\sum_{s}^{}{\\sum_{f}^{}e}m_{\\text{ocsfpt}}\\)\nCPAT also covers the other parts of the UNFCCC inventories (i.e., GHGs other than \\(CO_{2}\\), and other categories than energy-related GHGs). Methane emissions have a specific treatment for the most part. In the case of energy-related emissions, we treat methane emissions intensities for fossil-fuel production. They are inputed to the UNFCCC inventories emissions calculations. This is detailed in the next section.\n\n\n3.5.4.2 Methane (\\(CH_{4}\\))\nEnergy-related methane emissions calculations are based on the same logic as for \\(CO_{2}\\) emissions, except for fossil fuel production emissions. Therefore we will only focus here on fossil fuel production. Oil and natural gas are first grouped together, then we consider downstream fossil fuel and biomass. We finally multiply the fossil fuel production with the associated emission factor, per year. This gives us the energy-related methane emissions.\n\nMethane emission intensities for fossil-fuel production\n\nThe initial step involves the calculation of emissions intensity by determining baseline emission factors for each unit of energy produced or extracted. In the policy scenario, these emission factors undergo modification based on the application of a methane fee. Abatement cost curves specific to methane are utilized, employing a functional form represented by a power function structure where a coefficient A is multiplied by the methane fee, subsequently raised to the power of coefficient B. This approach results in a reduction of the emission factors by a certain percentage relative to the baseline level.\nThe emissions are calculated through:\n\\[\nem_{oc,oil/nga/coa,CH_{4},t} = prod_{oc,oil/nga/coa,t} * ef_{c,oil/nga/coa,CH_{4},After Abatment, t}\n\\]\nwith \\(prod_{oc,oil/nga/coa,t}\\) being the production of crude oil or natural gas or coal at time \\(t\\), in ktoe.\n\nChange in fossil-fuel production/demand\n\nWe use the assumptions on the global demand for oil, natural gas and coal that come from the IEA, and we then assume that the country level change and production just follows the global trend. If there’s some path pass through, then the global trend is adjusted downwards for reduced demand.\nFocusing more on that production calculation, we take the percentage change of producer prices for oil/natural gas/coal due to the methane fee (if defined by the user) at time \\(t\\), then the ratio of the global demand of oil/natural gas/coal at time \\(t\\) by the same demand a \\(t-1\\) (we take and average between oil and gas, and treat coal seperatly), and we finally multiply all of those factors by the production value at \\(t-1\\). If there is a pass-through of carbon price/methane fee to the consumers, this is also taken into account.\nThe methane emission factor After Abatement for a specific fuel is equal to the methane emission factor for that fuel on which we apply a percentage of reduction.\nSpecifically, this percentage of reduction \\(red\\) is obtained based on the value of the methane fee \\(mf\\), and a power function structure such as:\n\\[\nred_{ocf, CH_{4}, t} = A * mf_{t}^{B}\n\\]where A and B are the inputs for the abatment curve.\nRegarding the oil and gas sector, an assumption is made that a portion of methane emissions is mitigated through flaring, which facilitates the conversion of methane to CO2. The calibration of this reduction quantity is based on an EPA dataset.\n\n\n3.5.4.3 Nitrous oxide (\\(N_{2}O\\)) and Flourinated gases (F-gases)\n\\(N_{2}O\\) and F-gases energy-related emissions estimates follow the below rules:\n\nTotal energy-related \\(\\mathbf{N}_{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{O}\\) emissions are scaled to \\(CO_{2}\\) emissions. For \\(t > 2019\\):\n\n\\[\nem_{oc,N_{2}O,t} = em_{oc,N_{2}O,\\left( t - 1 \\right)}*\\frac{em_{\\text{oc},CO_{2},t}}{em_{\\text{oc},CO_{2},\\left( t - 1 \\right)}}\n\\]\n\nTotal energy-related F-gases emissions (\\(p = \\text{PF}C_{s}\\), \\(\\text{HF}C_{s}\\), \\(SF6\\), \\(NF3\\)) are historically zero for the energy category. For \\(t > 2018\\): \\(em_{\\text{ocpt}} = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n3.5.5 Non-energy related emissions\nNon-energy-related emissions are estimated across non-energy-related sectors (i.e. Agriculture, Industrial Process, LULUCF, Waste, and Other) for the four GHGs (i.e. \\(\\text{CO}_{2}\\), \\(CH_{4}\\), \\(N_{2}O\\) and F-gases). Non-energy-related emissions in the different sectors considered above are determined based on various sector-specific assumptions. In particular:\n\nIn the industrial processes and product use sector, the growth rate is based on changes in energy-related industrial \\(CO_{2}\\) emissions.\nNon-energy agriculture emissions are forecasted based on the GDP and population growths.\nForecasted non-energy emissions for LULUCF are driven by a sink activity growth and the ratio of the growth in emissions for the carbon tax scenario to the increase in emissions for the baseline scenario. Net sources and net sinks are treated differently (see below)\nFor waste and other emissions, forecasted estimates are determined by population growth.\n\n\n3.5.5.1 Industrial processes and product use\nIn the industrial processes and product use sector, the growth rate is based on changes in energy-related industrial \\(CO_{2}\\) emissions.\nIn what follows, the index \\(u = I\\), standing for Industrial Processes and Product Use.\nNon-energy-related industrial \\(CO_{2}\\) emissions are forecasted based on an industrial energy-related \\(CO_{2}\\) emissions rate (\\(\\text{Δe}m_{ocP,CO_{2},t + 1}\\)). Therefore:\n\\[\n\\Delta em_{ocI,CO_{2},t + 1} =\n\\begin{cases}\n    \\max\\left(0,\\frac{em_{\\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t + 1}}{em_{\\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t}} - 1\\right) & \\text{for } t = 2019 \\\\\n    \\frac{em_{\\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t + 1}}{em_{\\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t}} - 1 & \\text{for } t > 2019\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe index \\(\\text{Eind}\\) stands for the energy-related emissions in the industrial sector.\nImportantly, it is assumed that other pollutants \\(p\\) are scaled on the same industrial \\(CO_{2}\\) emissions rate. In other words, emissions of each pollutant for a year \\(t\\) is the sum of emissions from the previous year \\(t - 1\\) adjusted by the change in industrial \\(CO_{2}\\) emissions \\(\\text{Δem}\\).\nFor \\(t > 2019\\): \\(em_{\\text{ocIpt}} = em_{\\text{ocIp}\\left( t - 1 \\right)}*\\left( 1 + \\text{Δe}m_{\\text{ocI},CO_{2},t} \\right)\\)\n\n\n3.5.5.2 Agriculture\nNon-energy agriculture emissions (except for methane emissions) are forecasted based on the GDP and population growths (and a proxy for additional mitigation efforts – if selected by the user). We consider livestock and rice production.\nFor this section, \\(u = A\\).\nAgricultural emissions are projected using a similar approach to the rest of CPAT: a reduced-form approach with elasticities, notably per capita income \\(\\epsilon_{Y}\\) (GDP growth: \\(Y_{\\text{grow}}\\)) and population \\(\\epsilon_{\\text{lp}}\\) specific to each UNFCCC emissions sector (population growth: \\(lp_{\\text{grow}}\\)).\nIn addition, the user has the option to assume that non-\\(CO_{2}\\) GHGs scale with fossil \\(CO_{2}\\), which is a proxy for additional (e.g., non-pricing) mitigation effort \\((ame\\)) in the UNFCCC categories. This option, in effect, turns a carbon price into an all-sector (incl non-energy sectors) GHG tax (incl. methane, N20 etc).\nFor each pollutant (except methane) and for \\(t > 2019\\):\n\\[\nem_{\\text{ocApt}} = \\frac{em_{\\text{ocAp},t - 1}}{\\text{am}e_{A,t - 1}}(1 + Y_{\\text{growth}})^{\\epsilon_{Y}}*\\left( 1 + lp_{\\text{grow}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{\\text{lp}}}*\\text{am}e_{\\text{At}}\n\\]\nIn the case of non-energy agriculture methane emissions, we can have a change in the agriculture and waste production if there is a pass-through of the methane fee. Unlike the oil/natural gas/coal production function explained in the energy-related methane emissions section, the production function for agriculture takes into account the effect of poppulation and GDP growth. We also consider the percentage change of oil producer prices caused by the methane fee. Then, the agricultural sector has its own inputs for the abatement curve in order to obtain the associated emission factor.\n\n\n3.5.5.3 Land use, land-use change and forestry\nLULUCF GHG are assumed to be flat in the baseline and policy scenario for net sink countries (where sinks of GHGs exceed sources). For countries where LULUCF is a source, we assume an exogenous decline of 2.5% per annum in both the baseline and policy scenario. The user should note that this rate can be adjusted in the dashboard.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.31: LULUCF emissions decline rate\n\n\nAt the global level, this aligns with approximately the midpoint of IAMs’ projection for LULUCF. Where the country assumes ‘additional mitigation effort in non-energy sectors’ LULUCF GHGs decline at the rate of energy \\(_{}\\).\nFor this section, \\(u = L\\).\nIt is considered that a defined amount of emissions can be subtracted yearly, based on the 2019 level. Therefore, we introduce the LULUCF emissions decline \\(\\text{Δe}m_{L,t}\\) (in annual %, in absolute value of the start year).\n\nFor \\(p = CO_{2}\\):\n\nIn the case of \\(CO_{2}\\), we create a condition to model the sink activity of LULUCF (\\(em_{\\text{ocLpt}} < 0\\) or \\(> 0\\)). In both cases, we subtract an annual capture of \\(CO_{2}\\) based on the LULUCF emissions decline \\(\\text{Δe}m_{\\text{Lt}}\\). If the emissions of the previous year \\(t - 1\\) are positive, we scale the emissions with the ratio \\(\\frac{a\\text{me}_{cLp,t}}{\\text{ame}_{\\text{cLp},t - 1}}\\) with \\(a\\text{me}_{cLp,t} = \\ \\frac{em_{P,cLt}}{em_{B,cLt}}\\), which represents the ratio between energy-related emissions under a policy and baseline scenario.\nFor \\(t > 2019\\):\n\\[\nem_{\\text{ocLpt}} = \\begin{cases}\nem_{ocLp,t - 1} - \\left\\| em_{\\text{ocLp},2019}\\cdot\\Delta em_{L,t} \\right\\| & \\text{if }em_{ocLp,t - 1} < 0 \\\\\n\\frac{em_{ocLp,t - 1}}{ame_{cLp,t - 1}}\\cdot ame_{cLpt} - \\left\\| em_{\\text{ocL},2019}\\cdot\\Delta em_{L,t} \\right\\| & \\text{if }em_{ocLp,t - 1} \\geq 0 \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(p = CH_{4}\\):\n\nThe same logic as for \\(CO_{2}\\) is used, without considering the condition for sinks.\nFor \\(t > 2019\\):\n\\(em_{\\text{ocLpt}} = \\frac{em_{\\text{ocLp}\\left( t - 1 \\right)}}{\\text{am}e_{B,L,t - 1}}*\\text{am}e_{P,Lt} - \\left| em_{\\text{ocLp},2019}*\\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \\right|\\)\n\nFor \\(p = N_{2}O\\):\n\nIn the case of \\(N_{2}O\\), we assume the level of emissions to grow accordingly to the population growth \\(lp_{\\text{grow}}\\).\nFor \\(t > 2019\\):\n\\(em_{\\text{ocLpt}} = \\frac{em_{ocLp,t - 1}}{\\text{am}e_{B,L,t - 1}}*\\text{am}e_{P,Lt}*\\left( 1 + lp_{\\text{grow}} \\right) - \\left| em_{\\text{ocLp},2019}*\\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \\right|\\)\n\nFor F-gases (\\(p = \\text{PF}C_{s}\\), \\(\\text{HF}C_{s}\\), \\(SF6\\), \\(NF3\\)):\n\nIn the case of F-gases, we assume the level of emissions to grow accordingly to the population growth \\(lp_{\\text{grow}}\\). However, it is the only case where we do not consider the LULUCF emissions decline.\nFor \\(t > 2019\\):\n\\(em_{\\text{ocLpt}} = \\frac{em_{\\text{ocLp},t - 1}}{\\text{am}e_{B,Lp,t - 1}}*\\text{am}e_{P,Lt}*\\left( 1 + lp_{\\text{grow}} \\right)\\)\n\n3.5.5.3.1 Waste and Others\nFor waste and other emissions, forecasted estimates are determined by population growth.\nFor this section, we consider that \\(u = W\\) and \\(O\\), denoting respectively Waste and Others type of emissions.\nWaste emissions are projected using a similar approach to Agricultural emissions: a reduced-form approach with population growth elasticity \\(\\epsilon_{\\text{lp}}\\) (population growth: \\(lp_{\\text{grow}}\\)). We include again the additional (e.g. non-pricing) mitigation effort \\(\\text{ame}\\).\nFor each pollutant and for \\(t > 2019\\):\n\\(em_{\\text{ocupt}} = \\frac{em_{\\text{ocup},t - 1}}{\\text{am}e_{B,u,t - 1}}*\\text{am}e_{P,ut}*\\left( 1 + lp_{\\text{grow},t} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{\\text{lp}}}\\)\nIn the case of methane emissions, we can have a change in the agriculture and waste production if there is a pass-through of the methane fee.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.6 National Determined Contributions\nCPAT harmonizes National Determined Contributions (NDCs) for 192 countries to show target GHG emissions levels (excluding LULUCF) in 2030, based on several major NDC characteristics, that is conditionality and sectoral coverage. This section presents the different types of NDCs. Country cases illustrating how NDCs are calculated in CPAT are presented in Section 3.9.4 calculations.\n\n3.5.6.1 Types of NDCs\nThere are different types of NDCs:\n\nBusiness as usual (BAU) targets: NDC target is a percent reduction from the country’s BAU scenario. For example, Albania’s NDC is 11.5% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the baseline scenario in 2030.\nFixed targets: NDC target is a fixed level of GHG/CO2 emissions in target (future) year. For example, Argentina’s NDC is a cap of 359 MtCO2e net emissions in 2030.\nHistorical targets: NDC target is a percent or fixed reduction from the level of emissions in past years. For example, Australia’s NDC is 26 to 28% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030.\nIntensity targets: NDC target is a reduction in emissions intensity. For example, Uruguay’s NDC is emissions intensity reduction (GHG/GDP) of 24% in CO2 from 1990 levels.\nUnquantifiable targets: NDCs with no specific emissions reduction commitments. For example, Saudi Arabia’s NDC: “The Kingdom will engage in actions and plans in pursuit of economic diversification that have co-benefits in the form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission avoidances and adaptation to the impacts of climate change, as well as reducing the impacts of response measures.”\n\nNDCs could also present conditional and unconditional targets:\n\nUnconditional targets: Countries would use their own resources and technologies to achieve unconditional goals.\nConditional targets: Countries would need international support to achieve these (more ambitious) goals.\n\n\n\n3.5.6.2 Harmonization of NDCs: Country cases\nCPAT excludes LULUCF emissions from NDC calculations, so in case LULUCF emissions were included in initial document, the goals are recalculated with LULUCF, using the latest available data for LULUCF GHG emissions and user-identified growth parameters for these emissions. If not stated, we assume that the NDC target includes LULUCF.\nBy default, CPAT models the impact of carbon pricing on energy-related emissions. Hence, for countries with high levels of emissions from non-energy related sources (agriculture, waste, LULUCF), the calculations would imply a high burden on energy sector to achieve NDC goals. For more information, see Section 3.9.4 calculations, which presents examples of NDCs calculations."

    "section": "3.6 Fiscal revenues",
    "text": "3.6 Fiscal revenues\nThe fiscal revenues section in the mitigation tab of CPAT is organized as follows:\n\nInformation about total fuel expenditure, broken down per fuels and sectors, and revenues/losses from price controls broken down per fuel. These data are not used in the calculation of fiscal revenues.\nPolicy coverage showing the percentage coverage of CO2 emissions under the policy selected and for each sector group and fuel.\nThe different components of the fiscal revenues detailed in the subsequent section.\n\n\n3.6.1 Overview\nRevenues from mitigation policies are estimated by comparing any revenues from the policy and fuel taxes, net of any outlays from fuel subsidies, in the baseline scenario with those in the policy scenario. Fiscal revenues in CPAT are calculated for several types of taxes, by fuel and sector. Revenue-raising policies include carbon taxes, ETSs with auctioned allowances, increases in fuel/electricity excises, and reductions in fossil fuel subsidies. Revenue-reducing policies include expenditures (e.g., on renewable subsidies) and regulations (which reduce the base of pre-existing fuel taxes).\nCPAT differentiates two types of revenues:\n\nCarbon tax revenues, which are the result of the carbon tax multiplied by emissions factor and energy use.\nFull revenues, which include other taxes, VAT changes, excise duties, existing ETS schemes, etc. The changing revenues according to a carbon tax are not just simple revenues but also any changes associated with full revenues. For instance, there could be changes in subsidies due to changes in energy consumed.\n\nA general formula for fiscal revenues calculations is:\n\\[\nrev_{ocfgt}=F_{ocfgt}*\\varphi_{cgft}*ncp_{ocfgt}\n\\]\nwhere \\(rev_{ocfgt}\\) is the fiscal revenues in scenario \\(o\\) from country \\(c\\) from fuel \\(f\\) in sector \\(g\\), \\(F_{ocfgt}\\) is the energy consumption, \\(\\varphi_{\\text{cgft}}\\) is the sector-fuel coverage and \\(ncp_{ocfgt}\\) denotes the tax (policy) rate per unit of energy consumption.\nIn the dashboard, the graph below (Figure 3.32) shows total additional (vs. baseline) fiscal revenues from the policy, net of renewable energy subsidies. Note that this includes base effects (for example, a reduction on the tax base due to the policy) on existing taxes and subsidies, so even a revenue-neutral policy that nevertheless changes the base of existing taxes will have some effects on these, net, revenues.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.32: Dashboard: Fiscal revenues raised by fuel and total as % of GDP\n\n\n\nThe user can also see total revenues (i.e. not against the baseline scenario) according to the different fuels, net of subsidies (Figure 3.33).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.33: Dashboard: Total revenues by fuel source net of subsidies\n\n\n\nThe remaining of the section presents the calculations of revenues and its breakdown in more details.\n\n\n3.6.2 Notation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\nVariable\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(rev\\)\nFiscal revenues\nReal 2021 US$bn\n\n\n\\(F\\)\nEnergy consumption\nktoe\n\n\n\\(\\varphi\\)\nSector-fuel coverage\n%\n\n\n\\(ncp\\)\nNew Carbon Price\nUS$/ton of CO2\n\n\n\\(revExi\\)\nRevenues from existing excises and other taxes\nReal 2021 US$bn\n\n\n\\(cs\\)\nConsumer-side subsidy\nUS$/Gj\n\n\n\\(fao\\)\nFixed/ad val part/other\nUS$/Gj\n\n\n\\(xct\\)\nCurrent carbon tax\nUS$/Gj\n\n\n\\(xetsp\\)\nCurrent ETS permit price\nUS$/Gj\n\n\n\\(revVAT\\)\nRevenues from VAT\nReal 2021 US$bn\n\n\n\\(vat\\)\nValue added tax\nUS$/Gj\n\n\n\\(cstPs\\)\nLosses from producer-side subsidies\nReal 2021 US$bn\n\n\n\\(subDem\\)\nSubsidized demand\nBillion liters for oil, GJ for coal and natural gas and GWh for electricity\n\n\n\\(pusF\\)\nPer-unit fossil fuels subsidies\nUS$/liters for oil, US$/GJ for coal and natural gas and US$/GWh for electricity\n\n\n\\(cstRen\\)\nCost of renewable subsidies\nReal 2021 US$bn\n\n\n\\(pusRen\\)\nPer-unit renewable subsidies\nUS$/kwh\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3 Total revenues raised by policy\nFiscal revenues are calculated according to the selected power model (Elasticity, Engineer or Average) and are expressed in billions of dollars (in real terms based on the year 2021) and as a percent of GDP. Please note that revenues can be broken down per fuel. Total revenues are composed of:\n\nRevenues from the baseline scenario raised for each fuel and sector. The estimation of these revenues follows the general formula for fiscal revenues presented above (i.e., the carbon tax multiplied by emissions factor and energy use).\nRevenues from existing excises and other taxes, including consumer-side subsidies. This describes all existing taxes and consumer side subsidies. Excise and other taxes are composed of:\n\nConsumer-side subsidy: \\(cs_{ft}\\);\nFixed/ad val part/other: \\(fao_{ft}\\);\nCurrent carbon tax: \\(xct_{ft}\\); and\nCurrent ETS permit price: \\(xetsp_{ft}\\).\n\n\nFor each fuel, we multiply the fuel consumption (minus the other energy use part, which is assumed not to be covered by excises) by the sum of all the current excises. If the existing ETS is EU ETS, then the excise and other taxes from current ETS permit price are not taken into account. It is worth noting that for coal and natural gas, the formula below is used across sectors as these fuels are broken down per data on excise taxes in the sector groupings (i.e., industry, buildings and power sectors).\nRevenues from existing excises and other taxes, \\(revEx_{ft}\\), are thus estimated as follows:\n\\[\nrevExi_{ft} = \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n             (F_{ocft} - F_{oc,oen,ft})* (cs_{cft} + fao_{cft} + xct_{cft}) & \\mbox{if } Existing ETS = EU ETS \\\\\n             (F_{ocft} - F_{oc,oen,ft})* (cs_{cft} + fao_{cft} + xct_{cft} + xetsp_{cft}) & \\mbox{if } Existing ETS \\ne EU ETS\n    \\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nwhere \\(F_{ft}\\) denotes energy consumption and \\(F_{oen,ft}\\) energy consumption in the Other Energy Use sector grouping.\nFor electricity, revenues from additional excise tax are also estimated based on the power prices determined in the engineer power model. The additional excise tax is multiplied by the energy use and the consumer-side tax/subsidy in the residential sector and the tax/subsidy on industrial users in the non-residential sector.\n\nRevenues from additional excise tax (if it exists – additional excise tax can be inputted in the Manual Inputs tab.) raised for each fuel and sector, calculating as the additional excise tax multiplied by the energy use. For electricity, however, it is worth noting that revenues from additional excise tax relies on the engineer power model estimations.\nRevenues from VAT. Following the same logic as for existing excises and other taxes and additional excise taxes, revenues from VAT are calculated across sector grouping as the multiplication of the fuel consumption (minus the other energy use part \\(F_{oen,f,t}\\), which is assumed not to be covered by the VAT) by the associated VAT payment rate \\(vat_{cft}\\):\n\n\\[\nrevVAT_{ft} = (F_{ocft} - F_{oc,oen,ft}) * vat_{cft}\n\\]\nFor electricity, revenues from VAT are obtained by multiplying the energy use by the VAT payment in the residential non-residential sectors.\n\nLosses from producer-side subsidies. Producer-side subsidies represent a loss and are thus subtracted from total fiscal revenues. They do not affect the calculation of prices in CPAT and thus revenues unless they are phased out, if they exist. Note that implicitly the underlined that we are using has already been adjusted for producer-side subsidies, in particular in the case of coal. Producer-side subsidies, \\(cstPs_{ocft}\\), are defined as the product between the per-unit subsidies34, \\(pusF_{ocft}\\), and the subsidized demand, \\(subDem_{ocft}\\):\n\n\n\nLosses from producer-side subsidies. Producer-side subsidies represent a loss and are thus subtracted from total fiscal revenues. They do not affect the calculation of prices in CPAT and thus revenues unless they are phased out, if they exist. Producer-side subsidies, \\(cstPs_{ocft}\\), are defined as the product between the per-unit subsidies35, \\(pusF_{ocft}\\), and the subsidized demand, \\(subDem_{ocft}\\):\n\n\n\nLosses from producer-side subsidies.

They do not affect the calculation of prices in CPAT and thus revenues unless they are phased out, if they exist. Note that implicitly the underlined that we are using has already been adjusted for producer-side subsidies, in particular in the case of coal. Producer-side subsidies, \\(cstPs_{ocft}\\), are defined as the product between the per-unit subsidies36, \\(pusF_{ocft}\\), and the subsidized demand, \\(subDem_{ocft}\\):\n\n\\[\ncstPs_{ocft} = subDem_{ocft} * pusF_{ocft}\n\\]\nwhere subsidized demand is determined based on both global demand data from the IEA and domestic demand data directly estimated in CPAT. The estimation of subsidized demand differs depending on the fuel considered. For oil, subsidized demand is equal to global demand as it is a global traded product. Subsidized demand for coal and natural gas represent 50% of global demand and 50% of domestic demand. Finally for electricity, only domestic demand is used and depends on the power model selected. Subsidized demand can also vary according to the global energy demand scenario selected in the dashboard (see Figure 3.34). In addition, per unit subsidies are taken from the Prices section of CPAT. For coal, gasoline and natural gas, per unit subsidies correspond to the average across all sectors. Importantly, per unit subsidies are equal across sector grouping. For electricity, producer-side subsidies are retrieved from the non-residential sector (i.e., denoted as industrial sector) of the Power Prices section of CPAT, determined in the engineer power model.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.34: Dashboard: Global energy demand scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of renewable subsidies (if applicable – renewable subsidies are defined by the user in the dashboard). If specified by the user, \\(cstRen_{ocft}\\) represents the cost of implementing renewable electricity subsidy (or tax). In addition, the user can also add renewable subsidies under the baseline scenario. This cost is thus equal to the product between \\(pusRen_{ocft}\\), the cost of renewable subsidies in $/kWh (in real terms) and, \\(g_{ocft}\\), the electricity supplied in the power sector according to the power model chosen.\n\n\\[\ncstRen_{ocft} = pusRen_{ocft} * g_{ocft}\n\\]\nThese costs are estimated for each renewable energy, that is wind, solar, hydropower and other renewables.\n\n\n3.6.4 Additional information\nRevenue or losses from price controls and total fuel expenditures can also be found in the Fiscal Revenues section of CPAT. These estimations are not used in the calculation of the total fiscal revenues.\n\n3.6.4.1 Revenues/losses from price controls\nRevenues/losses from price controls, \\(ct_{ocft}\\), are calculated by multiplying fuel consumption across sectors (minus the other energy use part, on which price control does not apply) by the difference in fuel’s international prices from the current year to the previous one, \\(pInt_{ocft} - pInt_{ocf,t - 1}\\), and by the portion of global energy price changes not passed-through into domestic prices, \\(pth_{ocft} - 1\\).\n\\[\nctr_{ocft} = (F_{ocft} - F_{oc,oen,ft}) * (pth_{ocft}-1) * (pInt_{ocft} - pInt_{ocf,t-1})\n\\]\n\n\n3.6.4.2 Total fuel expenditures\nTotal fuel expenditures are not part of the fiscal revenues, but show the expenditures on fuel from a whole country perspective, as this is often relevant in developing countries wishing to minimize their import bill. Fuel expenditures are estimated for each fuel considered in CPAT and are expressed as the product between prices and energy consumption across all sectors."

    "text": "3.7 Monetized social costs and benefits\nIn this section, the theoretical framework is first presented in order to explain the approach used to assess efficiency costs and domestic environmental co-benefits. Then, this section describes how energy externalities costs are estimated. Finally, these costs are used to calculate monetized welfare benefits.\n\n3.7.1 Overview\nFigure 3.35 provides a representation of the fossil fuel market, where supply and demand interact. Importantly, it is assumed that the energy demand responds to prices in the private sector, although the institutional setup could, in some markets, play a role in preventing prices from determining supply and demand.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.35: Efficiency costs and co-benefits in the presence of prior-tax and carbon charge\n\n\n\nAt any point, the height of the demand curve reflects the benefit to consumers from an extra unit of consumption, while the height of the supply curve (drawn as flat here because constant returns to scale is assumed) reflects the cost to firms of producing an extra unit. If there is no pre-existing tax or subsidy in the market, the consumer and producer price are equal, and the market equilibrium is efficient (leaving aside environmental impacts) because the benefit to consumers from the last unit consumed equals the cost to firms of supplying that unit.\n\n3.7.1.1 Efficiency costs without a prior tax\nIntroducing a carbon tax in a country is distortionary by nature from a local perspective (since it does not correct for a local externality per se), but with the aim of contributing to a global reduction in emissions (i.e., it contributes to reducing global externalities). Suppose a carbon charge, equal to a carbon tax times the fuel’s CO2 emissions factor, is now applied to the fuel. The charge drives a wedge between the price paid by fuel users and the price received by fuel producers and reduces fuel use, resulting in an economic efficiency cost indicated by the shaded triangle abg. This efficiency cost is equal to the loss of benefits to consumers from the fuel reduction, the integral under the demand curve or trapezoid adeg, less savings in production costs to firms, rectangle bdeg.\nAlternatively, the efficiency cost can be interpreted as the loss in consumer and producer surplus (jkga) less revenue gains to the government where the latter is rectangle jkba. Consumer surplus reflects the benefits of fuel use to consumers less the amount they pay for the product (jkga) and is reduced from triangle hkg to triangle hja by the carbon charge. Producer surplus reflects revenue gains to firms less production costs consumption but is zero with and without the carbon charge as constant returns are assumed.\n\n\n3.7.1.2 Efficiency cost in the presence of a prior tax\nIt is now supposed that a prior tax on fuel use is applied. This prior tax drives a wedge between the consumer and producer price in the initial equilibrium as indicated in Figure 3.35. The efficiency cost of the carbon charge is now given by trapezoid acfg. Again, this reflects losses in benefits to consumers from the fuel reduction, trapezoid adeg, less savings in production costs, rectangle cdef. Alternatively, it is the loss in consumer surplus, trapezoid jlma, less revenue gains to the government, rectangle jlca.\nIn this case the efficiency cost has two components: (i) one-half times the carbon charge (per ton of CO2) times the overall CO2 reduction; and (ii) the pre-existing tax per unit of fuel use, times the fuel reduction, and aggregated across fuel markets.\n\n\n3.7.1.3 Efficiency costs in CPAT\nThe efficiency cost can be (approximately) computed by the ‘Harberger triangle’, that is, one-half times the carbon charge expressed per unit of fuel use times the fuel reduction. If the carbon charge is applied to multiple fuel products, the efficiency cost is the sum of Harberger triangles across the fuel markets. Equivalently, the efficiency cost is simply one-half times the carbon charge (per ton of CO2) times the overall CO2 reduction, which corresponds to the integral under the marginal abatement cost (MAC) schedule where the latter is the horizontal summation of individual MAC curves for all the behavioral responses promoted by the carbon charge.\nIn CPAT, the efficiency costs follow the Harberger methodology, i.e., efficiency costs are treated as deadweight costs, \\(ddw\\). These costs correspond to the area of the trapezoid described above, which is expressed as follows:\n\\(ddw_{ft} = \\frac{\\left( nc_{ft} - xcp_{ft} \\right)}{2}*(F_{P,ft} - F_{B,ft})\\)\nWhere the first term \\(\\frac{\\left( ncp_{ft} - xcp_{ft} \\right)}{2}\\) represents the average of new and pre-existing tax, respectively denoted \\(ncp_{ft}\\) and \\(xcp_{ft}\\), and \\(F_{P,ft} - F_{B,ft}\\) corresponds to the change in fuel consumption from the baseline to the policy scenario.\n\n\n3.7.1.4 Co-benefits\nIf it is now supposed that there are also local air pollution or other domestic environmental costs associated with use of the fuel product as indicated in Figure 3.35. The reduction in fuel use from the carbon charge reduces these costs by rectangle ncfo, which corresponds to the domestic environmental co-benefits. In short, the area acfg is presumably due to the externality created from fossil fuel use in the first place – and hence that is why the entire ncfo area could be a benefit. The net economic benefit is defined as the domestic environmental co-benefits—excluding global climate benefits—less efficiency costs. This is shown by trapezoid noga, as the co-benefits exceed the efficiency cost. More generally co-benefits might offset a portion of (rather than more than offsetting) efficiency costs in which case net economic benefits are negative.\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Energy externalities costs\nExternalities are deadweight losses from the tax before revenue recycling and do not include revenue recycling and tax interaction effects. In the dashboard of CPAT, energy externality costs are calculated under the baseline scenario and include costs above the marginal cost, that is costs related to air pollution, congestion, road damage and accidents and global warming (see Figure 3.36). The sum of these externalities, including the supply costs and the potential VAT, actually defines what is called the ‘efficient price’.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.36: Dashboard: Global energy demand scenario\n\n\n\nThese costs are displayed by fuel (i.e. coal, natural gas, electricity and liquid fuel, gasoline, diesel, LPG and kerosene) and sectors grouping (except for liquid fuels) and broken down by various components:\n\nSupply costs as defined in the Prices section of CPAT.\nAir pollution costs. These costs are associated mortality and morbidity attributed to air pollution. Averted mortality is valued using a Value of the Statistical Life (with the method selected by the user) and morbidity, measured as years lived with disabilities, is valued using a fraction of wages. See ?sec-eco_ap of the Air Pollution modulefor methodological details.\nRoad accident costs and Congestion costs37. The main road transport co-benefits of a carbon tax are a reduction in road accidents (from a reduction in driving, changes in the vehicle fleet, less aggressive driving, etc.) and a reduction in congestion (from a reduction in driving, an increase in car sharing, changes in the vehicle fleet, changes in transport timing decisions, etc.). Externality costs are estimated based on the baseline and policy forecast (i.e. adjusted for the fuel price change using a country-specific elasticity) accidents/congestion. The monetary value of accidents (multiplying fatalities by value of statistical life) and congestion (multiplying time lost in traffic times value of travel time) is then computed. Finally, the change in value of accident/congestion is divided by the change in motor fuel consumption.\nGlobal warming costs are by default defined at the global level. These costs are estimated based on the damage per ton CO2 (in real USD$ 2021) and the level of CO2 emissions under both scenarios. Note that several social cost of carbon can be selected:\n\nThe damage per ton of CO2 is by default set to a social cost of carbon, fixed to 75USD$ in 2030, implying an annual rise in real terms from 2018 of the social cost of carbon of 4%.\nEstimated social costs by Ricke et al. (2018) for which the national social cost of carbon discount rate and elasticity of marginal utility can be modified. Note that Ricke et al. (2018) estimates are country specific. More information can be found in the tab “SCC” of CPAT.\nThe social cost of carbon can also rely on the Global US EPA estimates with a 2.5% discount rate.\nFinally, the user can manually enter a social cost of carbon (in US$2021 per ton of CO2), assuming that the latter starts in year 2021.\n\n\nThese options can be modified in the dashboard:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.37: Dashboard: Social cost of carbon (SCC) assumptions\n\n\n\n\nPotential VAT can be calculated on the supply cost only or on the supply cost augmented by all externalities (the default).\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Monetized welfare benefits\nCPAT provides an assessment of climate co-benefits associated with carbon pricing and fossil fuel price reform. Welfare benefits induced after the introduction of the carbon tax include the monetized following items (in real USD$ 2021), which are estimated based on the description of the costs described in the above section:\n\nAverted climate damages (national) is defined as the difference between the total national global warming costs in the baseline and the policy scenario.\nAverted air pollution mortality/morbidity is taken from the Air Pollution module. The air pollution welfare gains are calculated from reduced mortality and morbidity attributed to improvements in air pollution. Averted mortality is valued using a Value of the Statistical Life (with the method selected by the user) and morbidity is valued as a fraction of wages. See ?sec-eco_ap of the Air Pollution module for methodological details. \nAverted road accidents are taken from the transport module and represent the change in the number of road accidents induced by the implementation of the policy selected by the user, which thus corresponds to externality benefits.\nReduced congestion is taken from the transport module. In the same vein, external benefits from reduced congestion results from the change in traffic induced by the implementation of the policy selected by the user.\nEfficiency costs are defined as the deadweight costs resulting from the carbon tax (i.e. the average of existing and new carbon tax introduced) and the change in fuel consumption for each fuel considered, including electricity.\n\nCPAT dashboard shows monetized net welfare benefits as percentage of GDP (see Figure 3.38).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.38: Dashboard: Total monetized welfare"

    "text": "3.8 Validation\n\n3.8.1 Overview\nIt is important to note that the validation exercise differs from the calibration. While the calibration performed for some variables throughout the mitigation module prevents the model from deviating from observed data (i.e. for 2019 to 2021), particularly in the context of COVID-19, the validation analysis covers a broader time horizon and aims to explore how the mitigation module performs against other models or to compare it against the literature. The analysis also includes sense-checking and parameter sensitivity analysis of the parameters defined in the mitigation module. The validation is organized as follows:\n\nElasticities estimations. As CPAT is mainly driven by elasticities with respect to prices and economic activity, an econometric analysis is carried out to compare the elasticities used in CPAT and those obtained from an empirical analysis.\nComparison of CPAT against other models.\nEx-post studies. This section presents the literature’s estimates of the effectiveness of carbon pricing with respect to emissions and compares them to the CPAT results.\nHindcasting. The hindcasting exercise aims at testing CPAT’s forecasts against observed data. It searches to evaluate the performance of the used assumptions when trying to reproduce historical information.\nParameter Sensitivity Analysis. The analysis explores the sensitivity of a set of selected parameters.\n\nBefore deep diving into the validation analysis, a first step in the validation process is performed to ensure that CPAT produces reliable data, especially for the data fed into the rest of the validation analysis. To further validate CPAT and check its functionality for all countries the T and Tt scenarios have been created in the Multiscenario Tool to test 826 parameters used in CPAT. The T-scenarios use average power models and show how CPAT behaves under different carbon taxation and how these parameters change. There are six testing scenarios:\n\nT0-T6, when T0 has no carbon tax;\nT1 (small carbon tax scenario) introduces 12$ carbon tax with 20$ target carbon tax;\nT3 (medium carbon tax scenario) introduces 36$ carbon tax with 60$ target carbon tax;\nT6 (high carbon tax) introduces 120$ carbon tax with 200$ target carbon tax; and\nThe T2, T4 and T5 introduce intermediate rates for comparison.\n\nIn addition to these scenarios, the scenarios denoted Tt (i.e. T0t-T6t) use engineer model instead of Average power models and hold the same assumptions and carbon tax rates as the T scenarios described above (i.e. T0-T6). In order to test CPAT, the following steps were performed:\n\nSettings. The T0-T6 use average model, while T0t – T6t scenarios use engineer model.\nModel runs. The MT is run using the same defaults.\nData. The database is then compiled, retaining CPAT’s output on 826 parameters for 218 countries.\n\nThe scenarios aim to provide data for further Parameter Sensitivity, hindcasting and comparison analysis, as well as signal any problems with country specific results, i.e. due to the poor data quality. Based on the outcomes, we classify countries into working and ones which produce spurious results. The Table on Countries coverage presented in the User Guide results from this testing.\n\n\n3.8.2 Panel estimation of energy demand\n\n3.8.2.1 Introduction\nThis section describes the results from the estimation of some of the fuel demand equations incorporated in CPAT. The aim is to\n\nDeliver an empirical view of the elasticities with respect to price and economic activity;\nEstablish the size and direction of any linear trend in fuel consumption; and\nReflect on the difference between the value of the elasticities and trends estimated in this study and those currently used in CPAT.\n\nElasticities describe the percentage change in a dependent variable in response to a percentage change in an independent (driving) variable. As an example, a price elasticity equal to -0.3 implies that a 100% increase in the price delivers a 30% reduction in fuel consumption. In the case of models using data undergoing a logarithm transformation, the elasticity with respect to a given variable is simply the estimated coefficient on that variable.\n\n\n3.8.2.2 Methodology\nThe approach used here reflects underlying CPAT model and database structure in relation to:\n\nFrequency of data and timespan. In the estimation we used annual data ranging between 2000 and 2018, i.e. the dataset currently incorporated in CPAT. This is a panel dataset in which information for a set of fuels consumed in a set of sectors (and their driving variables) is observed across time and countries (here taken as the unit dimension of the panel).\nDriving factors. Consumption of a fuel in a specific sector is assumed to be a function of fuel price (in that sector) and of the overall level of economic activity (as measured by the GDP), with both variables expressed in real terms.\nStatic functional form. The whole impact of a change in a driving variable, say, price, unfolds within the year covered by that observation. This means that last year’s prices have no impact on this year’s and future consumption.\nSectorial disaggregation. Results are reported based on the disaggregation underlying the current set of elasticities in CPAT (industrial, service, residential and transport) but data are available for a number of industrial subsectors and transport modes (as shown in Appendix B - Energy balances, Figure 3.69) which are used in the estimation. This implies that we are able to produce estimates for the elasticities of a fuel consumed in any industrial subsector, so that the range of these estimates for the industrial sector as a whole is indicated as with a boxplot in Figure 3.39 and Figure 3.40.\nFuel disaggregation. Results are reported based on the fuels underlying the current set of elasticities in CPAT (coal, electricity, natural gas, other oil products, biomass, diesel and gasoline). In the case of other oil products, we are able to rely on two fuels in the estimation: kerosene and lpg.\n\nWe estimated the fuel demand below for each combination of sector and fuel for which estimation was deemed relevant and feasible:\n\\(\\begin{matrix} \\text{ln\\:f}c_{\\text{it}} = \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{1}\\text{\\:ln\\:}y_{\\text{it}} + \\beta_{2}\\text{\\:ln\\:}p_{\\text{it}} + \\beta_{3}\\text{\\:t} + \\epsilon_{\\text{it}} \\\\ \\end{matrix},\\)\nwhere \\(fc_{\\text{it}}\\) indicates the consumption of a specific fuel at time t in country i in a specific sector, \\(p_{\\text{it}}\\) indicates the price for that fuel and \\(y_{\\text{it}}\\) the overall level of GDP in the country. There are no indices in relation to the sector and the fuel in the equation as estimation is conducted for each combination of fuels and sectors. The individual effects \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) reflect constant (across time) factors which affect fuel consumption in a specific sector in a specific country given the value of the independent variables in the model. An example for these factors could be energy efficiency policies affecting fuel consumption regardless of the level of economic activity and price. Finally, \\(t\\) is a linear time trend. We also introduced a time effect \\(\\lambda_{t}\\) but it was never found to be statistically significant when a linear trend was also included.\nIn terms of relevance, we excluded sectors for which the CPAT dataset contained data covering less than 0.5 GTOE while in terms of feasibility we required a minimum of about 300 observations for a sector-fuel combination to be included in the analysis. As a consequence, the number of units (countyries) used in the analysis varied from more than 150 in the case of gasoline used for road transport to 13 in the case of coal used for non-energy use or otherwise not included in other industrial subsectors.\n\n3.8.2.2.1 Adopted estimators\nThe following estimators were implemented: 1) the between estimator (BE); 2) the pooled OLS estimator (POLS) and; 3) the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CMG) estimator of M. Hashem Pesaran (2006). The results from the Between and Pooled OLS estimator are reported only for those cases when they produce consistent estimates, ie. when regressors are not correlated with individual effects as assessed by the Hausman test. The choice of these estimators was motivated by the aim of assessing the long-term impact of driving factors on fuel consumption - despite the use of a static functional form in CPAT - and evidence of Cross-Sectional Dependence (i.e. correlation across the units in a panel dataset).\nMore precisely, the choice of adopting these estimators is motivated by the following considerations:\n\nThe BE produces consistent estimates of long-run coefficients for a panel with adequate number of observations across time and units (in our case countries) as formally discussed in M. Hashem Pesaran and Smith (1995). It also produced the best estimate of long-run price coefficient for gasoline in the Monte Carlo simulation discussed in Baltagi and Griffin (1984), although estimates from POLS were not markedly different.\nThe POLS produced the most robust forecasts (assessed based on the RMSE) in the Monte Carlo study in Baltagi and Griffin (1984). In the same study, the BE produced very similar results, although with (slightly) higher errors.\nThe CMG estimator produces unbiased estimates when cross-sectional dependence (CSD), which was assessed based on the test in M. Hashem Pesaran (2015), is correlated to included regressors in the model. We used robust standard errors (Beck and Katz (1995);Driscoll and Kraay (1998)) to take into account cross-sectional dependence but this is a valid approach only if the unobserved factors responsible for correlation across units are not correlated to variables in the model, in our case fuel price and GDP. Although the CMG estimator is robust to any form of Cross-Sectional Dependence, the extent to which it captures long-term impact of driving variables in a static model is not clear.\n\nTwo versions of the equation above are implemented in the case of the POLS and CMG estimators: one with a global linear trend, one with a trend allowed to vary across countries. Considering the number of estimates we obtain we report only those which were statistically significant at the 10% level and conform to economic theory, e.g. positive elasticity on economic activity and negative on the fuel price.\n\n\n3.8.2.2.2 Data\nData used in this study reflects the dataset underlying CPAT. This means using:\n\nfuel consumption data from IEA energy balances;\nnominal GDP data from the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) database converted into real terms by using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) also from IMF’s WEO;\nnominal fuel prices data from IMF’s database, also converted into real terms by using the CPI index.\n\nAll the variables were converted into logarithms before the estimation.\n\n\n\n3.8.2.3 Results\n\n3.8.2.3.1 Price elasticities\nFigure 3.39 compares the estimates of price elasticities obtained here with those used in CPAT for the transport (quadrant A), residential (quadrant B), industrial (C) and service sector (D). Estimated elasticities are similar to those used in CPAT in the case of the:\n\nresidential sector, with the exception of electricity for which we estimated -0.1 - considerably lower than the -0.4 value used in CPAT;\nindustrial sector, with the of exception of diesel for which CPAT uses the high value of -1.1.\n\nDifference between the elasticity in CPAT (-0.61) and the value estimated here (-0.19) for gasoline in the transport sector might be related to the fact that only the estimate from the CMG estimator can be used in the comparison with CPAT. Low estimates for price elasticities of gasoline in road transport are however very established in the literature. A recent survey, Miguel Galindo et al. (2015), indicated -0.10 and -0.30 for short- and long-term elasticities, respectively, with our estimate (-0.19) falling right in the middle of this range.\nThe difference between elasticities estimated here and those used in CPAT is noticeable in the case of the Service sector. CPAT postulates fuel consumption being more price responsive than demand in industrial sector while our estimates point at elasticities being similar to those estimated in the residential sector. Assuming that there is considerable overlap between fuel uses in the service sector and in households (space heating, air conditioning and everyday electrical appliances), our findings of similar elasticities in the service and the residential sector seem plausible. Considering the difference between our estimates and CPAT and the growing importance of the service sector globally, this is a topic which should be explored further in the next iteration of CPAT.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.39: Comparison between price elasticities used in CPAT and those estimated in this study for transport ( A), residential (B), industrial (C) and service (D) sectors. The red triangles indicate an estimate obtained from one of the adopted estimators, while the blue triangles indicate the value of the elasticity used in CPAT. The boxplot in subplot C indicates the range of the estimates obtained for the industrial subsectors included in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.2.3.2 Elasticities with respect to economic activity\nFigure 3.40 compares the estimates of the elasticities with respect to economic activity with the values used in CPAT for the transport (quadrant A), residential (quadrant B), industrial (C) and the service sector (D). Estimated elasticities are similar to those in CPAT in the case of the:\n\nresidential sector, with the exception of electricity for which we estimated a relatively low (0.16) value compared to the value (0.65) used in CPAT;\nindustrial sector, with the of exception of natural gas for which CPAT uses a value of 0.81 while estimates here range between 0.33 and 0.56.\n\nDifferences still emerge in the transport (quadrant A) and in the service sector (quadrant D). With regard to the former, our estimates (ranging between 0.31 and 0.53 across fuels) are close to the results from the meta-analysis in Miguel Galindo et al. (2015) indicating short- and long-run income elasticities equal to 0.26 and 0.46, respectively. CPAT is currently using the higher value of 0.57 for gasoline and 0.65 for other oil products. With regard to the service sector, CPAT incorporates a stark difference between elasticities for biomass and diesel (with values up to 0.41) and those for electricity and natural gas (with elasticity as high as 0.9). In contrast, our estimates are more homogeneous across fuels with values at most as high as 0.7.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.40: Comparison between income elasticities used in CPAT and those estimated in this study for Transport (A), Residential (B), Industrial (C) and Service (D) sectors. The red triangles indicate an estimate obtained from one of the adopted estimators, while the blue triangles indicate the value of the elasticity used in CPAT. The boxplot in subplot C indicates the range of the estimates obtained for the industrial subsectors included in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.2.3.3 Linear trend\nCPAT includes a term called “annual autonomous improvement in efficiency” which conveys the annual percentage reductions in fuel consumption due to increasing energy efficiency. The intensity of this factor is stronger in the case of transport (average of about -0.5% across fuels) compared to the other sectors for which average for each fuel varies between -0.27 and -0.06%\nOur estimate of a global linear trend for the sector-fuel combinations included in this study presents quite a different picture, as a negative trend in consumption could be estimated only for coal and other oil products. In the case of biomass, electricity and natural gas the trend is positive. In the case of diesel and gasoline consumption in the transport sector, not reported in Figure 3.41, the estimated models pointed out at non-statistically significant linear trend.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.41: Comparison between the assumed annual autonomous improvement in efficiency in CPAT and the global linear trend estimated in this study. The red triangles indicate the average of the estimates from the models allowing for a global linear trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.2.4 Conclusions and areas for improvement\nThe empirical validation pointed out that the elasticities with respect to price and economic activity in CPAT tend to be on the same ballpark as those estimated here, with some exceptions mainly related to road transport and the service sector.\nThis exercise pointed out that estimated global linear trends are considerably different from the assumed impact of energy efficiency used in CPAT. With hindsight, this is not surprising, as estimated global linear trends include the impact of energy efficiency but also changing preferences for a specific fuel or the impact of changing sector decomposition. As an example, one would expect a positive linear trend in the case of biofuels in the transport sector due to the impact of policies facilitating substitution away from fossil fuels to renewable sources. CPAT might benefit from continuing to disentangle the perceived impact of energy efficiency (as currently done) especially if that coefficient could be linked to explicit policymaking.\nThis empirical validation has provided an opportunity for a thorough assessment of CPAT and how econometric analysis may inform values used in the model. This resulted in a number of considerations that will be explored in the next iteration of model development. In particular, CPAT is likely to benefit from including:\n\nElasticities estimated on an extensive dataset spanning about 4 decades which has been recently put together. Although this is a key development allowing the implementing of more sophisticated approaches and functional forms described below, as a first step, it seems helpful to focus on the estimators considered in this note.\nA more focused measure of economic activity. The use of GDP to measures economic activity for each sector included in CPAT is not supported by best practice in the energy literature and involves the risk of producing unstable estimates, and therefore forecasts. As an example, if the share of a sector’s economic activity in the whole economy changes in a specific direction, CPAT would under- or over-forecast fuel consumption in that sector. As historical data for more focused economic activity indicators are available for all sectors in CPAT, one would need to assess whether one could obtain forecast time series which are needed by the model to make this approach feasible.\nA more explicit treatment of long-run estimates. CPAT can incorporate the long-run / short-run distinction explicitly through an Error Correction Model (ECM) specification which is included in the macro-economic model of the World Bank or - perhaps more simply\n\nmaintain its current specification but include two sets of elasticities, one for long-run and the other for short-run forecasts, with the timing of the switch between the two informed by empirical evidence.\n\nA more explicit analysis of the impact of cross-price elasticities. This is a very important factor for a model assessing consumption for each fuel like CPAT. Systematic approaches to fuel substitution bring their own set of challenges (seee Agnolucci and De Lipsis (2020)), to the extent that a simpler ad-hoc method may be preferable at least as a starting point, perhaps focused only on the substitution of specific fuels in specific sectors.\nExploring feedback mechanisms between the variables incorporated in the model and their possible endogeneity. This does not seem a considerable concern considering the variables currently used in CPAT but may deserve its own empirical exploration if more focused indicators of economic activity (as consequence of point 2 and more likely to be endogenous) are used in the model.\nAssessing the extent to which elasticities vary across sectors and countries. The current version of CPAT includes the possibility of differentiating elasticities with respect to price and economic activity based on whether a sector is in a country belonging to the Lower Income, Lower Middle Income and Upper Middle-Income group on one side, and High-Income Country. The next phase of model development should thoroughly explore this possible source of heterogeneity alongside other sources, e.g. the possibility of allowing heterogeneous responses across industrial subsectors.\nTrying to disentangle the impact of energy efficiency from changing preferences for a specific fuel, either through variables related to explicit policymaking or incorporating evidence from specific policy events\n\n\n\n3.8.2.5 References\n\nAgnolcucci, P. & de Lipsis, V.

We will therefore:\n\nCompare CPAT’s baseline results against Enerdata and the IEA;38\nAssess the sensitivity to carbon price against the Enerdata POLES model;\nPut the two together: compare CPAT time trend for different carbon prices vs alternative models.\nExplore the power sector results compated against selected results from EPM\n\n\n3.8.3.1 Baseline validation\nThis section is dedicated to the assessment of the CPAT baseline results. The latter is observed and compared with other models/sources through time series. We use two sources for comparison. The first and main source used is the Stated Policies (STEPS) scenario of the IEA World Energy Outlook 2021, extracted from RFF’s Global Energy Outlook 2022 database. The second source used for comparison is Enerdata’s long-term Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC).\nIn both cases, the comparison is established based on specific indicators available in the different datasets (from Enerdata and from the IEA). We will therefore challenge both Average and Engineer models of CPAT.\n\n3.8.3.1.1 Comparison with the STEPS scenario of the IEA\nThe IEA’s STEPS scenario reflects current policy settings based on a sector-by-sector assessment of the specific policies that are in place, as well as those that have been announced by governments around the world.\nData for solar has been added manually from the IEA WEO 2021 as it was not included originally in the RFF dataset.\nWe only have 3 points of data from the IEA: 2019, 2020, and 2030. The indicators selected are: Total CO2 emissions, Primary energy consumption by fuel, and Electricity generation by fuel.\nOverall, the comparison shows comparable results between CPAT and the IEA STEPS scenario. Indeed the figures below suggest outcomes of same order of magnitude for the observed year (i.e. 2019, 2020 and 2021) and long-term projections are similar (see Figure 3.42).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.42: World energy related CO2 emissions comparison\n\n\nNote that it is not possible to observe the inflection point in 2022 in the IEA projection, as data point for the year 2022 is not available. As defined by RFF, Primary energy consumption displays the estimated energy content of fuels consumed prior to any conversion process.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.43: World primary energy consumption comparison\n\n\nOil in CPAT is the aggregation of Diesel, Gasoline, LPG, Kerosene, and Other Oil Products. A different aggregation could explain the difference observed in order of magnitude for Oil.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.44: World primary energy consumption comparison by fuel\n\n\nIn Europe and Eurasia, discrepancies are mainly driven by the results of Russia (see Figure 3.45). It is important to note that there is no data for Solar Electricity Generation per country in the RFF-GEO dataset for the IEA STEPS scenario. Strong divergence should be noted between the two models on the nuclear generation.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.45: Regional electricity generation comparison\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.46: Electricity generation comparison by fuel in World\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.3.2 Carbon Price Sensitivity\nThe sensitivity analysis is the observation of the evolution of the emissions depending on the carbon tax level. We will use the data from Enerdata in order to establish the analysis. We are taking into account both Average and Engineer models of CPAT. The graphs are indexed on the baseline scenario, as a 100% of emissions.\nWe will only consider 3 indicators: Total CO2 emissions, Energy related CO2 emissions - Power sector, and GHG emissions, exc. LULUCF. The focus is at the world level, for the year 2030. We see good alignment between the two models for all three indicators and both CPAT power model choices (average or engineer).\nNote here we abstract for any differences in baseline. See the previous and next sections for that topic.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.47: Total CO2 emissions\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.48: Energy related CO2 emissions - Power sector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.49: Total GHG emissions, exc. LULUCF\n\n\n\n\n3.8.3.3 Comparison with Enerdata’s long-term Enerbase scenario\nIt should be noted that Enerdata’s scenarios were formed before the Covid crisis.\nThis comparison is based on different carbon tax scenarios (including the baseline scenario), target for 2030: 0 USD/tCO2, 20 USD/tCO2, 40 USD/tCO2, 60 USD/tCO2, 80 USD/tCO2, 100 USD/tCO2, and 120 USD/tCO2. These scenarios are computed using the average and the engineer models of CPAT in order to add another layer of comparison. Enerdata presents CO2 MACC, which is going to be used as an equivalent to the target carbon tax. There are 3 points of data: 2025, 2030 and 2035.\nWe consider 5 indicators: Total CO2 emissions, Energy related CO2 emissions - Power sector - Industry - Buildings - Transportation, and GHG emissions, exc. LULUCF.\nResults show comparable results, with both models having similar slops. Enerdata’s outcomes are, however, higher and aligned with pre-covid results of CPAT, suggesting that the COVID-19 adjustment implemented in CPAT may explain the difference. In addition, it is worth mentioning that CPAT is calibrated on IEA’s data in the year 2019 to 2021, and IEA’s assumptions are less conservative than Enerdata when it comes to the share of coal power plant in the future.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.50: Total CO2 emissions, all scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.51: Total CO2 emissions, 0 USD/tCO2 in 2030 scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.52: Total CO2 emissions, 100 USD/tCO2 in 2030 scenario\n\n\nOverall, CPAT’s results are similar to Enerdata’s results. With a few exceptions, the figures below report a similar order of magnitude and comparable directions. In this comparison, the average power model of CPAT provides closer estimates to Enerdata’s scenarios.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.53: Energy related CO2 emissions - Electricity, all scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.54: Energy related CO2 emissions - Electricity, 0 USD/tCO2 in 2030 scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.55: Energy related CO2 emissions - Electricity, 100 USD/tCO2 in 2030 scenario\n\n\nThe figures below compare CPAT’s GHG emissions (exc. LULUCF) against Enerdata’s results. Similarly, outcomes are very close worldwide, although some discrepancies are observed in some regions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.56: GHG excl LULUCF emissions, all sectors\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.57: GHG excl LULUCF emissions, 0 USD/tCO2 in 2030 scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.58: GHG excl LULUCF emissions, 100 USD/tCO2 in 2030 scenario\n\n\n\n\n3.8.3.4 Power sector comparison vs. EPM\nThe power sector validation is made using the World Bank’s EPM model. The World Bank’s Electricity Planning Model (EPM) is a long-term, multi-year, multi-zone capacity expansion and dispatch model. The objective of the model is to minimize the sum of fixed (including annualized capital costs) and variable generation costs (discounted for time) for all zones and all years considered, subject to:\n\nDemand equals the sum of generation and non-served energy\nAvailable capacity is existing capacity plus new capacity minus retired capacity\nGeneration does not exceed the max and min output limits of the units\nGeneration is constrained by ramping limits\nSpinning reserves are committed every hour to compensate forecasting errors\nrenewable generation constrained by wind and solar hourly availability\nExcess energy can be stored in storage units to be released later or traded between the other zones\nTransmission network topology and transmission line thermal limits\n\nThe model is an abstract representation of the real power systems with certain limitations. EPM is used mostly to perform least cost expansion plans as well as dispatch analyses.\n\n3.8.3.4.1 Objectives\nThe main objective of this analysis is to validate the accuracy of the CPAT results by comparing them with selected results from the EPM model, for different countries. The following outputs are compared:\n\nElectricity Demand\nElectricity Generation\nNew Investments\n\n\n\n3.8.3.4.2 Methodology\nThe EPM model presents several different scenarios per country. Each scenario is defined by a 2030 carbon budget, most of the time defined as a 40% emission reduction relative to the BAU scenario. However, while the carbon budget is an input for the EPM model, it is an output for CPAT. Therefore, we used a goal seek in order to define a 2030 target carbon price in CPAT, which brought us to $40 t/CO2. This is an only approximately equivalent comparison: exact matching was difficult.\nWe use the Engineer model of CPAT for the entire comparison.\n\n\n3.8.3.4.3 Caveats\nPlease note the following caveats on the approach followed:\n\nEPM has a constraint in emissions and look to 2040 (80% emission reduction relative to BAU on average), but we work with 2030. In other words, we use a proportional ratio to set the target goal seek.\n\n\n\nThe fuel classification in CPAT does not exactly match the EPM ones. Therefore EPM “Fuel oil” will be considered as CPAT “Other oil products” (“Oil” in the legend), EPM “Onshore wind” and “Offshore wind” will be considered as CPAT “Wind”, and EPM “Geothermal” as CPAT “Other RE”. Storage is invested in CPAT but not reported so we do not compare it here.\nCPAT’s New Investments (MW) are considered spreaded in time, which explains their continuous aspect.\n\n\n\n3.8.3.4.4 Comparison\nThe comparison in terms on types of fuels in the energy mix and the order of magnitude of the shares reflect similar results. It is worth noting that the EPM model shows a higher share of wind in the electricity generation for some countries (e.g. Vietnam).\nIt is however more complicated to establish parallels in the case of developing countries, as EPM can suggest discontinuous generation/investments.\n\n\n3.8.3.4.5 Graphs\nThe following pages show, for a number of mostly African countries available in the EPM dataset, comparisons for the larger countries between CPAT and EPM of:\n\nOverall electricity demand.\nElectricity generation by generation type.\nNew investment by fuel type.\n\nComparison for a bigger set of countries, including smaller countries than previously, are available in the Appendix H (Section 3.9.8).\n\n\n3.8.3.4.6 Electricity Demand Comparison\n\n\n\nFigure 3.59: Electricity demand in Egypt, Iraq,South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.60: Electricity demand in Angola, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Jordan, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria and Zambia\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.3.4.7 Electricity Generation By Fuel Type\n\n\n\nFigure 3.61: Electricity Generation By Fuel Type in Egypt, Iraq, South Africa, Turkey, Vietnam\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.62: Electricity Generation By Fuel Type in Ghana, Jordan, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Ukraine, Zambia\n\n\n\n\n3.8.3.4.8 New Investments By Fuel Type\n\n\n\nFigure 3.63: New Investments By Fuel Type Egypt, South Africa, Turkey and Vietnam\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.64: New Investments By Fuel Type in Iraq, Morocco, Mozambique, and Ukraine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.4 Ex-post studies\n\n3.8.4.1 How effective is the carbon pricing, really? A literature review\nDespite voluminous literature on the carbon tax, few empirical works have investigated the effectiveness of a carbon tax and ETS in reducing emissions. Figure 3.65 provides a first attempt to compare the estimates according to three different methods employed in the literature, that is counterfactual scenario and the estimation of semi-elasticity. It is worth noting that this comparison might be imperfect as under a counterfactual scenario some estimates have been annualized based on the policy implementation window, similarly to Green (2021). Moreover, Figure 3.65 reports both short- and long-term estimates.\nTwo main key findings stand out from ex-post quantitative assessments of carbon pricing policies since 1990.\nFirst, experience with carbon pricing and hence the empirical evidence is primarily from developed and emerging economies. In particular, studies assessing the effectiveness of a carbon tax focus on OECD countries or Northern European countries, which implemented a carbon tax earlier and for which time series data are available. Only few recent studies evaluate ex-post estimates of the effects of carbon tax on CO2 emissions across the world. At the national level, particular emphasis is placed on British Columbia, Sweden and the United-Kingdom. With respect to the assessment of the ETS, the focus is, not surprisingly, on the EU, China, Germany and the United States.\nSecond, the estimates for overall emission reductions from carbon pricing are minimal to modest, falling in the range of 0 – 2 percent per annum, with significant variations across sectors, but also across countries (Green (2021)).\nNonetheless, several caveats have to be factored in before drawing conclusion:\n\nCarbon prices so far have had low coverage, low prices, or both. The sample size as well as the time horizon might still be too restricted to accurately examine the effect of a carbon pricing instrument. In this respect, empirical results acknowledge that the effects of taxes on emission reductions largely depend on the comprehensiveness of the instrument design and the level of the carbon tax (see Metcalf (2019)).\nThe carbon price appears to have a non-linear effect, indicating that its effect becomes stronger above a certain threshold (Aydin and Esen (2018)). For instance, emissions reductions attributable to the EU ETS during the second phase (2008-2012) are greater than during the first stage (2005-2007). In the first phase, allowances were freely allocated. In the second phase, the cap was tightened and prices higher.\nControl variables introduced in empirical studies may poorly capture the effect of the instrument alone. At the same time, isolating the effect of the carbon pricing instrument from other policies - which are not always considered as environmental policy measures - may lead to insignificant results. However, evaluating a carbon pricing instrument in conjunction with other instruments can lead to effectiveness (see, for example, Shmelev and Speck (2018), who find that a carbon tax is effective when evaluated with a set of policies).\nThe effects of rational ignorance may kick in and eliminate any impact. Given the transaction costs of investing in low-carbon technologies, agents may not be responsive to a price signal set below a certain threshold.\nWhen it comes to the ETS, generalized free allocation can mitigate incentives (e.g., through the creation of resource rents and barriers to entry). In addition, as more and more emissions are covered by ETSs (such as in China or in the EU) uncertainty on future prices may blunt the responsiveness of agents.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.65: Effects of carbon pricing instruments on average annual emission reductions: A literature review\n\n\n\nStudy estimates are adjusted to derive annual emission reduction effects of the carbon tax and the ETS to make estimates comparable.

Carbon Taxes in Theory and Practice, Annual Review of Resource Economics 2021 13:1, 245-265\n\n\n\n3.8.4.2 How does CPAT compare to the literature?\nIn order to compare CPAT’s semi-elasticity of CO2 emissions against the literature, the following settings are used:\n\nDue to low carbon prices, we employ a low step function, that is $10 per ton of CO2. Such a step function is comparable to studies estimating semi-elasticities.\nThe model is run for all countries for which data are available and factors in the total CO2 emissions of 171 countries.\nAs CPAT is forward-looking, it covers the period 2019-2035.\nAs most of studies analyzed their results against a counterfactual scenario, CO2 emission changes in CPAT are compared to the baseline scenario. The estimation of the short- and long- term semi-elasticities is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\nThe total CO2 emissions in ton/CO2 are retrieved from CPAT under the baseline and policy scenarios over the period 2019-2035.\nAnnual changes are thus computed between the baseline and the policy scenarios.\nShort-term semi-elasticities are arbitrarily calculated as an average of the annual changes over the period 2019-2023.\nLong-term semi-elasticities are estimated as an average of the annual changes over the entire period (i.e. from 2019 to 2035).\n\n\n\nFinally, CPAT holds the advantage to compare C02 emission changes across sectors (i.e. industry, power, residential and transport).\n\nThe table below (Table 3.1) presents the results. Long-term semi-elasticities are greater than short-term ones, indicating that changes that are not possible in a short period of time are more realistic over a longer time period. When looking into the range of CPAT’s estimates across all sectors, results are comparable with those of the literature (see Figure 3.65 above). At the sector level, the power sector records the highest decrease on the long run, which is consistent with Rafatya, Dolphin, and Pretis (2020) 39.\n\n\nTable 3.1: Short- and long-term semi-elasticities of CO2 emission in CPAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSector\n\n\nShort-term semi-elasticities\n\n\nLong-term semi-elasticities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll sectors\n\n\n-2.4%\n\n\n-6.2%\n\n\n\n\nIndustry\n\n\n-2.7%\n\n\n-6.2%\n\n\n\n\nPower sector\n\n\n-2.3%\n\n\n-8.4%\n\n\n\n\nResidential\n\n\n-2.2%\n\n\n-4.9%\n\n\n\n\nTransport\n\n\n-0.9%\n\n\n-2.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.4.3 References\n1.

Environmental Research Letters, forthcoming.\n\n\n\n3.8.5 Hindcasting\n\n3.8.5.1 Objectives\nThe hindcasting exercise aims at testing CPAT’s forecasts against observed data. It searches to evaluate the performance of the used assumptions when trying to reproduce historical information. In short, the process assumes an historical point in time as its base year, and projects all relevant variables. Key indicators are selected and their projections are compared to real/observed data.\n\n\n3.8.5.2 Methodology\nThe current results were obtained using a hindcastable version of CPAT (CPAT 1.0pre_043) with the help of the Multiscenario tool (MT v219). This is an out-of-sample forecasting exercise that simulates data from the year 2000 onward. The analysis uses CPAT methods to forecasts domestic prices, energy consumption and resulting emissions. Observed international prices for the forecasted period were fed as inputs to the simulation.\nAt the first stage, the focus is set on the forecasts of emissions; in particular, on GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF) and on energy-related CO2 emissions. The scenarios are run using six countries as test samples:\n\nAustralia (AUS)\nBrazil (BRA)\nChina (CHN)\nSouth Africa (ZAF)\nUnited Kingdom (GBR)\nUnited States (USA)\n\nNo Policy interventions were modeled, so the results correspond to the ‘Baseline’ output of the model.\nThe hindcasting exercise relies on an adapted version of CPAT and the MT files, where the first year of calculations is set to an historical point in time. All relevant data tables (e.g. energy consumption and domestic energy prices) are provided for that same base year. The exercise focuses on testing emissions projections, and hence not all features of CPAT are used.\nThe analysis covers annual data from 2000 to 2017, and assumes that consumption of a fuel in a given sector is a function of sector-specific fuel prices and overall level of economic activity, as measure by the GDP. Default settings and no-policy interventions are used for simulations.\nThe exercise consists of projecting key modeled variables and comparing those simulations with observed information. The checks are done on a country level basis, with a subset of those being presented here as a sample of results. Results are presented by means of figures, and tables of key statistics, namely the Root Mean Square error (RMSE) and its normalized version.40\n\n\n3.8.5.3 Comparing projected emissions across selected countries\nFor the selection of countries, CPAT has been able to capture the global trend in emissions. However, there are periods where the volatility of projections is larger than that of observed data, and where local trends, and in particular levels, are not properly captured. For a fixed set of elasticities, this gaps with respect to observed historical information can result from projected prices showing higher volatility than observed ones. This is explored in a subsequent stage.\n\n3.8.5.3.1 GHG (excl. LULUCF)\nCPAT shows a good performance on projecting the trend of emissions in most tested countries. A deeper look at the vertical axis’ scale of each plot will show periods of increasing gaps between projected and observed emissions. For a given set of price elasticities of demand, this could be explained by an inverse gap in projected versus observed domestic prices.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.66: Total GHG (mt.CO2e) excluding LULUCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: RMSE and Normalized RMSE, selected Countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n\n\nRMSE\n\n\nNormalized RMSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\n25.9641\n\n\n0.0505\n\n\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\n278.5110\n\n\n0.2551\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n9021.2421\n\n\n0.9151\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n207.1026\n\n\n0.3285\n\n\n\n\nUnited States of America\n\n\n672.3218\n\n\n0.0966\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\n\n73.7134\n\n\n0.1383\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.5.3.2 CO2 (energy-related)\nThe previous conclusions extends to the CO2 energy-related emissions. This data, however, should be considered with care as the observed emissions series exclude some years and a linear trend has been assumed to interpolate data for these periods (see for instance, 2007-2014).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.67: Total energy-related CO2 emissions (mt.CO2e)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: RMSE and Normalized RMSE, selected Countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n\n\nRMSE\n\n\nNormalized RMSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\n35.8338\n\n\n0.1011\n\n\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\n127.3467\n\n\n0.3635\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n8687.0478\n\n\n1.3373\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n155.2571\n\n\n0.3231\n\n\n\n\nUnited States of America\n\n\n637.0707\n\n\n0.1179\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\n\n85.9752\n\n\n0.2142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.5.4 A potential source of discrepancies: In-model price forecasts\nCPAT is an elasticity-based model where Emissions depend on fossil fuel consumptions, which in turn depend on fuel prices. It follows that, given the negative price elasticity of demand, an over-estimation (under-estimation) of prices with respect to the ones observed in reality, may lead to an under-estimation (over-estimation) of energy consumption, and hence emissions. The case of China, is a clear example of this. Projected prices are below observed historical ones. Since elasticities were computed based on historical prices, this results in higher hindcasted emissions than observed.\nIt should be noted, however, that the case of the UK escapes this explanation. The hindcasting tool projects lower emissions despite the lower modeled domestic prices. This gap in projected emissions would be amplified if considering in the model the policies that the UK implemented in the mid 2010s. These discrepancies remain for further analysis.\nThe tracking of historical information by the simulations may also be improved when setting short and long-term elasticities to model the energy consumption behavior. The current exercise only considers the former, and leaves the latter for further research.\nAs an additional remark, by construction, CPAT domestic prices for fossil fuels track international market prices for these fuels, and are adjusted with the help of an historical factor. The factor helps tame the volatility. However, for some countries, domestic observed prices remain smoother than projected ones. This may follow as well from policies like existing price regulations, not modeled in the current runs, and also left for further research.\n\n3.8.5.4.1 Coal prices (historical vs CPAT)\n\n\n\nDomestic retail prices of coal used in the power sector\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE and Normalized RMSE, selected Countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n\n\nRMSE\n\n\nNormalized RMSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\n35.8338\n\n\n0.1011\n\n\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\n127.3467\n\n\n0.3635\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n8687.0478\n\n\n1.3373\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n155.2571\n\n\n0.3231\n\n\n\n\nUnited States of America\n\n\n637.0707\n\n\n0.1179\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\n\n85.9752\n\n\n0.2142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.5.4.2 Coal prices (projected, historical domestic and international)\n\n\n\nHistorical retail prices of coal (domestic and international)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.5.4.3 All countries\nWhen considering the coal prices used for the power sector in all countries, it can be seen that CPAT forecasts are, on average, above observed prices. The set of figures below, shows this through the distribution of the relative difference (Projections/Observed), and its concentration under the value of “1”.\nA subset of years is taken as a reference, but the behavior is consistent for all years. This reinforces the idea that a second set of price elasticities of demand based on price projections may be needed.\n\n\n\nCoal prices, relative differences: CPAT projection/Observed domestic prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.5.5 Conclusions and additional analysis needed\nThe hindcasting exercise was focused on projecting emissions (GHG and energy-related CO2). It consists of a partial hindcasting, as the international prices used as inputs correspond to the outturn of prices (observed), instead of projections of prices dating from before the base year selected. It can, hence, serve to better study how the forecasting of domestic prices takes place once the true values of some inputs are known.\nFor the countries analyzed, CPAT generally shows a good performance capturing the historical trends of the respective variables. In most cases, however, the volatility of observed data is not replicated with CPAT projections. Moreover, depending on the country, CPAT’s projections appear to be persistently under (over) estimating values with respect to historical ones. While this may result from the implementation of policies that were not modeled in the exercise, it can also result from discrepancies in price forecasting, and may be subject to additional country-specific adjustments.\n\n\n\n3.8.6 Parameter Sensitivity Analysis\n\n3.8.6.1 Objectives\nThe parameter sensitivity analysis explores the sensitivity of a set of selected parameters with regard to:\n\nThe power sector assumptions;\nMacroeconomic adjustments;\nElasticity adjustments; and\nPrice source adjustments.\n\nThe analysis aims to propose a classification of the sensitivity of the parameters, i.e. how CPAT behaves when changing the default parameters, and more especially how the change in parameters affects the emissions’ reductions.\n\n\n3.8.6.2 Methodology\nIn order to test the sensitivity of the parameters, the following steps were performed:\n\nSettings. Default parameters are used for G20 countries and for a carbon tax increasing from 10$ to 75$.\nModel run. The MT is run using the same defaults but changing one parameter only.\nData. The database is then compiled, retaining CPAT’s output on emissions for G20 countries.\nComputation.\n\nChange in Emissions: Carbon Tax $75 in 2030 vs Baseline\nRelative change (i.e. to the default parameter) in percentage points (pp). The difference between the change of CO2 emissions recorded under the default setting and the change in CO2 emissions under the other options is computed in order to analyse how each option is sensitive to the baseline parameter.\n\nOutput. Create a sensitivity classification of parameters affecting CPAT’s behavior (no sensitivity/negligible/sensitivity/high sensitivity).\n\n\n\n3.8.6.3 Results\nBased on the methodology described above, the sensitivity of the parameters to CPAT to CO2 emissions varies from no effect to very sensitive when focusing on the relative changes (i.e. CO2 emissions reduction relative to the default parameter). The following rule-of-thumb is used to classify the sensitivity of the parameters:\n\nNo effect: no variation\nNegligible: less than 2 percentage points\nSensitivity: between 2 and 5 percentage points\nHigh sensitivity: more than 5 percentage points\n\nThe table below summarizes the results of the sensitivity analysis.\n\n\n\nCPAT’s parameters sensitivity results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nAssumptions\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nChange in Emissions: Carbon Tax $75 in 2030 vs Baseline\n\n\nRelative change (i.e. to the default parameter) in percentage points (pp)\n\n\nSensitivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower model\n\n\nAverage*\n\n\nAverage between the elasticity and engineer models.

We divide all energy flows into three main categories:\n\nRaw energy supply,\nEnergy transformation, and\nFinal energy consumption.\n\nFor each country \\(j\\), the balancing flow in raw energy supply category is Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES), which should be equal to the sum of Imports, Production, Exports (negative), Stock changes, International marine bunkers (only on the world level) and International aviation bunkers (only on the world level). Stock changes and bunkers were combined in “Stock and bunker changes (STOCKCHA)” flow.\n\\(\\text{TPE}S_{j} = \\text{Productio}n_{j} + \\text{Import}s_{j} - \\text{Export}s_{j} + \\text{STOCKCH}A_{j}\\)\nEnergy transformation category includes the following IEA flows: transformation processes (TOTTRANF, includes electricity generation), transfers (TRANSFER), energy industry own use (OWNUSE), distributional losses (DISTLOSS), and statistical differences (STATDIFF). The balancing equation for total final consumption (TFC) is:\n\\(\\text{TF}C_{j} = \\text{TPE}S_{j} + \\text{TOTTRAN}F_{j} + \\text{TRANSFE}R_{j} + \\text{OWNUS}E_{j} + \\text{DISTLOS}S_{j} + \\text{STATDIF}F_{j}\\)\nIn transformation processes, we separate the power sector - transformation of fuels into electricity. We include main activity producer electricity plants, autoproducer electricity plants, main activity producer CHP plants, and autoproducer CHP plants. The main sector groups in final energy consumption are:\n\nIndustry\nTransport\nBuilding\nPower sector\n\nWe disaggregate transport and industry further to sectors.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.69: Sectors disaggregation in CPAT\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9.2.3 CPAT fuels and sectors overlap\nThe fuels and sectors specified above form an energy balances table in the mitigation module, which shows the amount of fuels consumed by each subsector in industry, transport, residential or other sector for energy purposes, and the amount of fuels consumed in the power sector to generate electricity (see the screenshot).\n\n\n\nFigure 78: Energy Balances\n\n\nFigure 3‑48: Energy Balances\nAs the energy balances and prices are the main inputs for the Mitigation module, it is also essential to understand the overlap between energy prices and energy consumption by sector and fuels. The table below depicts the energy consumption table obtained in CPAT following transformations from international sources and CPAT’s own projections. For fossil fuels and electricity we have sector-specific or general energy prices and taxes per energy unit (please see a separate documentation on CPAT Prices and Taxes), for renewables we use price indices instead.\nFigure 3‑49 explains the overlap of CPAT energy prices and sectors.\n\n\n\nFigure 79: CPAT energy prices and sectors overlap\n\n\nFigure 3‑49: CPAT energy prices and sectors overlap\n\n\n3.9.2.4 Energy Consumption (EC) construction for CPAT\nThe purpose of this section is to present the sequence of processes applied to build and project Energy Consumption data in CPAT format, that is also sufficiently derived from original international sources. This process is applied as well to build a set of time series of Energy Consumption used for regression analysis and hindcasting.\nRaw Inputs:\n\nEnergy Balances (EB) from IEA (yearly information. 2018 and 2019)\nEnergy Balances (EB) from Enerdata (yearly information. Last update:\n\n\n\n\nIntermediate inputs:\n\nCPAT projected Energy Consumption (EC) (2019)\nUser defined parameters for projections and for EC adjustment\n\nOutcome:\nEnergy Consumption tables created using CPAT own structure, assumptions and projections based on raw data published by international databases. The table below depicts an example structure of such table:\n\n\n\nFigure 80: Energy Consumption\n\n\nFigure 3‑50: Energy Consumption\nThe CPAT energy consumption projections for the base year include a sub-process under which the fuel transformation sector is created. In CPAT we transform balances into final energy consumption (buildings, industry, transport, other), power sector (part of energy transformation in balances) and fuel transformation. Fuel Transformation sector is determined by the difference between primary and final energy consumption, subtracting Fuel Transformation in the power sector. Additionally, all oil products plus natural gas are aggregated to avoid dealing with negative fuel consumption.\nSummary: The following diagram summarizes the process.\n\n\n\nFigure 81: Energy Balances process\n\n\nFigure 3‑51: Energy Balances process\n\n\n\n3.9.3 Appendix C - Prices And Taxes Methodology\nEnergy prices and taxes are among the main inputs of the Mitigation module. They include information on (1) domestic energy prices by fuel and sector, (2) governmental price controls, (3) international energy prices and forecasts, and (4) existing carbon pricing mechanisms (carbon taxes and ETS). This document reflects the main principles and data sources used to build the CPAT Prices and Taxes part of the Mitigation module, information on assumptions used in calculations, and the main outputs of the Mitigation module that directly depend on the prices and taxes data.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.70: Mitigation module scheme: prices and taxes\n\n\n\nThe main data sources for prices and taxes inputs include:\n\nFor international energy price forecasts: energy price scenarios from the World Bank (Commodity Markets Outlook, “Pink Sheet” data), IMF (World Economy Outlook), IEA (World Energy Outlook), and EIA (International Energy Outlook);\nFor domestic energy prices and forecasts: historical fuel- and sector-specific prices from Enerdata, IEA, IMF FAD, and other sources;\nFor current carbon pricing mechanisms: historical and planned carbon taxation or ETS information, mainly based on the Carbon Pricing Dashboard;\nFor subsidies: IMF Energy Subsidies Template, ODI, other data sources\n\nBased on the historical data and policy specifications, including sub-sectoral exemptions, the Mitigation module calculates the changes in energy prices and their impact on energy consumption. These energy prices and their changes are used as inputs in the distributional and road transport modules.\n\n\n\n3.9.3.1 User options affecting prices in CPAT\nThis section lists the user’s choices and briefly explains how these choices will affect further calculations. For more details, please refer to specific parts of this document.See Figure 3.71 for a snapshot of the parameters affecting prices in CPAT.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.71: Dashboard parameters affecting prices\n\n\n\n\n3.9.3.1.1 Policy coverage and exemptions\nThe user can choose what fuels and sectors to tax on the Dashboard (see Figure 3.72). The fuels and sectors not selected would be exempted from the policy.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.72: Dashboard: Policy coverage\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the user decides whether to phase out exemptions or not and the period to phase out exemptions (see Figure 3.73).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.73: Dashboard: Exemptions\n\n\n\nNote: if the fuel is exempt and the phase-out is active, the carbon pricing policy (new carbon tax or ETS) will increase by 1/n every year starting from the year in which the policy would be introduced, where n is the number of years to phase out exemptions. The user can trace exemptions in the “New policy coverage: CO2 emissions covered” graph on the Dashboard.\n\n\n3.9.3.1.2 Choices of the sources for key inputs\nThe user can choose the source for international and domestic energy prices:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.74: Dashboard: Sources for key inputs\n\n\n\nThe options for key inputs include “manual,” which the user can fill in a separate “Manual inputs” tab:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.75: Manual inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9.3.1.3 Policy options: Existing carbon pricing policies\nThe user can choose to apply existing carbon tax or ETS (if they exist) on the Dashboard:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.76: Dashboard: Policy Options\n\n\n\nWhen there is a previous carbon tax or ETS in place, the user also has an option to specify the price growth for future years in the “Advanced options” of the Dashboard:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.77: Dashboard: Advanced Policy Options\n\n\n\nPlease note the following:\n\nEven if the user decides not to apply existing carbon pricing mechanisms, it will not affect historical prices, only forecasted.\nExisting policy coverage for carbon tax and ETS permit prices are fractional. When considering sector and fuel coverage, for existing policies, CPAT accounts for the fraction of the consumption that is affected by the policy. This differs from the treatment of coverage under the new, user-defined, policies. There, the option to include or not a sector or fuel is binary. For new policies, a fractional coverage only occurs when the user selects to exempt a sector or fuel, and to phase out that exemption in time.\n\n\n\n3.9.3.1.4 Policy options: New excise / existing excise exemptions\nThe user can add a manual per-unit of energy excise, by choosing the “Add additional excise” option on the Dashboard and filling a relevant part of the “Manual inputs” tab.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.78: Manual inputs: Manual Policy Options\n\n\n\nThe user also has an option not to apply existing excise taxes starting from the policy year (existing excises are applied by default):\n\n\n\nFigure 3.79: Dashboard: Existing tax removal\n\n\n\nPlease note:\n\nIf the user decides not to apply existing non-carbon taxes, this decision will affect only policy forecast, not baseline and historical data. Moreover, it the user decides to keep existing policies in place, by default those will be projected with the existing sector and fuel coverage and not with the one the user may use for newly-introduced policies. \nAs discussed before, existing policy coverage for carbon tax and ETS permit prices are fractional, while the coverage for new policies is binary. Indeed, when considering sector and fuel coverage, for existing policies, CPAT accounts for the fraction of the consumption that is affected by the policy. This differs from the treatment of coverage under the new, user-defined, policies. There, the option to include or not a sector or fuel is binary. For new policies, a fractional coverage only occurs when the user selects to exempt a sector or fuel, and to phase out that exemption in time.\n\n\n\n3.9.3.1.5 Policy options: VAT reforms\nThe user can include externalities to be part of the VAT base for optimal taxation (included by default): \n\n\n\nFigure 3.80: Dashboard: VAT Reform\n\n\n\nAlso, the user can choose to apply the same VAT tax rate in the residential and transport sectors if it is different from the general VAT in the economy (“advanced options” in the Dashboard):\n\n\n\nFigure 3.81: Dashboard: Adjusting VAT per sector\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9.3.1.6 Fossil fuel subsidies reform\nThe user can choose to phase out fossil fuel subsidies (producer- and/or consumer-side) over a specified period (n years). The fossil fuel subsidy will decrease linearly by 1/n every year starting from the year the user chose to start the phase-out until they reach zero or a specified limit.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.82: Dashboard: Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the user can choose to phase out only a part of the fossil fuel subsidies in the “advanced options” of the Mitigation module. \n\n\n\nFigure 3.83: Dashboard: Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform (Advanced Mitigation Options)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9.3.1.7 Price liberalization\nThe user can choose to calculate the impact of the government energy price control in the “advanced options” of the Dashboard and the source for price control coefficients (manual or regional). The choice will not affect historical price components but will affect calculations of fiscal revenues or losses.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.84: Dashboard: Price liberalization (Advanced Mitigation Options)\n\n\n\nNote. Do not use price liberalization and fossil fuels subsidies phase out simultaneously to avoid double-counting.\n\n\n\n3.9.3.2 Price components\n\n3.9.3.2.1 Assumed pricing mechanism\nFigure 3.85 below presents the main components of fuel prices in CPAT.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.85: Main components of baseline prices\n\n\n\nSupply cost is an average price that includes all price components like production and transformation costs, transportation and distribution costs, profits, and others, except taxes.\nRetail price is an average end-user price paid by the final user in the corresponding sector (power generation, industry, transport, residential) per unit of energy, including all applicable taxes and subsidies. According to IEA, the historical retail prices are calculated as a ratio of total sales of energy to the sold volume. The retail price should equal the supply cost plus all relevant taxes:\n\\[\np_{cgf,t}=sp_{cgf,t}+ttx_{cgf,t}\n\\]\nwhere \\(p\\) is the average retail price, \\(sp\\) is the price before taxes and \\(ttx\\) is the total taxes for country \\(c\\), fuel \\(f\\) in sector group \\(g\\) and year \\(t\\). This holds for both the baseline and the policy scenarios.\nNote: In general, carbon pricing policies and the phasing out of consumer-side subsidies will affect the \\(ttx\\) component, while the phasing out of existing producer-side subsidies will instead affect the supply cost \\(sp\\).\nPrice gap/total taxes/subsidy: the gap between the supply cost and retail price. This is a function of any type of taxation and/or subsidization that causes the supply cost to deviate from the import/export parity price plus mark-ups and the any taxes applied to the price before tax, such as VAT, excise taxes, and other taxes (environmental, renewable support taxes, energy security taxes, social taxes, and others). The historical values of \\(ttx\\) are calculated in the dataset as a difference between average retail price and price before taxes and, thus, are negative in the case of a net subsidy. For forecasted years, the value of \\(ttx\\) will instead be computed as the sum of the forecasted subcomponents (different types of taxes and consumer-side subsidies).\n\\[\nttx_{cgf,t} = p_{cgf,t} - sp_{cgf,t}\n\\]\nwhere \\(ttx\\) stands for the total net taxes (or net subsidy if negative), \\(p\\) is the average retail price and \\(sp\\) is the supply cost (i.e. the price before tax). By construction, this relationship holds for all scenarios.\nVAT payment: historical values are calculated in the dataset as VAT base (price before tax plus all other taxes except VAT) multiplied by the VAT rate. The VAT rate is assumed to be 0 for industrial and power generation users since these users receive a credit on their input VAT.\n\\[\nvat_{c,f,g,t} = \\left( sp_{c,f,g,t} + txo_{c,f,g,t} \\right)*vatrate_{c,f,g,t}\n\\]\nwhere \\(VAT\\) is the VAT payment per energy unit, \\(txo\\) represents the excise and other taxes/subsidies and \\(VATrate\\) is the VAT rate.\nExcise and other taxes: calculated in the historical dataset as a difference between retail price, supply cost, and VAT payment.\n\\[\ntxo_{cgf,t} = p_{cgf,t} - sp_{cgf,t} - vat_{cgf,t}\n\\]\nFor the forecasted years, instead, it is computed as the sum of its projected components. This, as in the scenarios we decompose the Excise and other taxes category to several additional price components, such as current carbon tax, current ETS permit price, new policy, new excise tax (if applicable), and fixed/ad-valorem part / other, which includes price controls (if applicable).\nThese categories (except new policy and new excise tax), being the Excise and other taxes category components, do not affect the retail price.\n\nCarbon tax/ETS permit price: ‘effective’ carbon tax/ETS permit price as a component of total taxes is calculated separately in CPAT based on existing carbon pricing mechanisms and emission factors. Details are provided below.\nNew policy/new excise tax: the main driver of the change in retail prices. They are calculated as components of the excise and other categories, depending on the chosen policy (new carbon tax, ETS, road fuel tax, others) and emission factors. By default, in the baseline scenario, new policy/new excise taxes are equal to zero.\nSubsidies: per unit of energy subsidy is calculated as a sum of all subsidies over the total final consumption by sectors (power, industry, residential, transport). The details are provided below.\n\n\n\n3.9.3.2.2 Assumptions used for price reconstruction and projections\nRetail prices:\n\nTakes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab\nUses CPAT generated prices if the data exist\nOtherwise, calculated as a sum of the supply cost, VAT and other (excise + environmental) taxes\n\nSupply costs:\n\nTakes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab\nUses CPAT generated prices if the data exist\nOtherwise:\n\nFor the first year: if no data whatsoever, uses the global (regional if possible) price\nFor the second year and after, calculated as the previous year’s supply cost multiplied by the global (regional) prices’ growth rate\n\n\nVAT payments:\n\nTakes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab\nUses CPAT generated prices if the data exist\nOtherwise:\n\nFor the first year:\n\nFor the power and industry sectors, assumes 0\nfor the residential and “all” sector, calculated as the sum of the supply cost and excise and other taxes multiplied by the general VAT rate in the country\n\nFor the second year and after, if no data, uses a proportion to the supply cost with other taxes from the previous year\n\n\nExcise and other taxes:\n\nTakes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab\nUses CPAT generated prices if the data exist\nOtherwise, if no data whatsoever: Assumes 0 for the first year, and uses a proportion to the supply cost from the previous year for the second year and after (would be changed later when we’ll have working carbon pricing mechanisms tab)\n\nCurrent carbon tax and ETS permit price: Uses CPAT generated prices if the data exist (would be changed later when we’ll have working carbon pricing mechanisms tab)\n\n\n\n3.9.3.3 Forecasted prices (after 2021)\n\n3.9.3.3.1 Assumptions for forecasted prices\nRetail prices: Sum of the supply cost and all applicable taxes: excise and other + existing ETS/carbon tax + new ETS/carbon tax\nSupply costs: Previous year’s supply cost multiplied by the growth rate of the respective global fuel prices\nVAT payments: Ratio of the previous year’s VAT payment to the supply cost with excise and other taxes multiplied by the current year’s sum of the supply cost and excise and other taxes (plan: should give the user an option to apply VAT before or after taxes)\nExcise and other taxes:\n\nIf “fixed” – equals to the previous year’s absolute value of the price gap that is not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax, plus applicable carbon pricing mechanisms (current/new ETS/carbon tax)\nIf “ad-valorem” – equals to the ratio of the previous year’s part of the price gap that is not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax to the supply cost, multiplied by the current year’s supply cost, plus applicable carbon pricing mechanisms (current/new ETS/carbon tax)\nPlan: additionally, should be corrected to the price control (as a part of the retail price that the government would change in order to keep the retail price controlled)\n\nCurrent carbon tax and ETS permit price:\n\nValues from the “Existing carbon pricing mechanisms (ETSs and carbon taxes) and price controls” New carbon tax and ETS permit price:\nValues from the respective scenarios (zeroes for the baseline scenario)\n\n\n\n3.9.3.3.2 Calculations: Modeling assumptions\nFor years starting from 2021, the price components are modeled by following rules.\nRetail price for fuel \\(f\\) in sector grouping \\(g\\) in year \\(t\\) is a sum of the supply cost and all applicable taxes (VAT payment, excise and other taxes):\n\\[\np_{cgf,t}=sp_{cgf,t}+txo_{cgf,t}+vat_{cgf,t}\n\\]\nSupply cost for fuel \\(f\\) in sector grouping \\(g\\) in year \\(t\\) is calculated using a coefficient of supply costs to base years (2017-2019) to the global prices in the same period, multiplied by the respective international fuel price in year \\(t\\):\n\\[\nsp_{cgf,t}=\\frac{sp_{cgf,t-1}}{gp_{f,t-1}}*gp_{f,t}\n\\]\nwhere \\(sp_{cgf,t}\\) denotes the average supply costs for country \\(c\\), fuel \\(f\\) in sector grouping \\(g\\) in year \\(t\\), \\(gp_{cgf, t}\\) is the global fuel price for the previous year \\(t\\), \\(gp_{cf,t}\\) is global fuel price based on the chosen international energy price forecast in year \\(t\\).\nProducer-side fossil fuel subsidy is equal to the previous year’s per unit of energy producer-side fossil fuel subsidy unless the user decides to phase out fossil fuels.\nVAT payment equals the previous year’s VAT payment ratio to the supply cost multiplied by the current year’s supply cost:\n\\[\nvat_{cgf,t}=\\frac{vat_{cgf,t-1}}{sp_{cgf,t-1}}*sp_{cgf,t}\n\\]\nExcise and other taxes components are decomposed into five categories: current carbon tax, current ETS permit price, new policy component, new excise tax, and fixed/ad-valorem part/other taxes.\n\nCurrent carbon tax and ETS permit price: if the user decides to apply existing carbon pricing mechanisms, the values will be calculated based on historical values and planned policies. If a country’s carbon pricing policy is not specified for years after 2020, the current carbon tax / ETS permit price per energy unit, \\(xcp\\), is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nxcp_{cgf,t} =xct_{cgf,t} + xetsp_{cgf,t}\n            =xct_{cgf,t_0}*(1+\\delta_{CT})^{t-t0} + xetsp_{cgf,t_0}*(1+\\delta_{ETS})^{t-t_0}\n            =XCT_{c,t_0}*ef_{cgf}*\\varphi_{XCT,cgf,t_0}*(1+\\delta_{CT})^{t-t_0} +\n             XETSP_{c,t_0}*ef_{cgf}*\\varphi_{XETS,cgf,t_0}*(1+\\delta_{ETS})^{t-t_0}\n\\]\nAs show above, the existing carbon price per energy unit results from scaling the existing carbon taxes and ETS permit prices from the base year, \\(XCT\\) and \\(XETSP\\) respectively, by their specific coverage \\(\\varphi\\), the fuel-sector-specific emissions factor \\(ef\\), and the user-defined growth rate of the nation-wide price for the forecasted years \\(\\delta\\).\n\nNew policy component:\n\n\\[\nncp_{cgf,t} = nct_{cgf,t} + netsp_{cgf,t}\n            = NCT_{c,t}*ef_{cgf}*\\varphi_{NCT,cgf,t} + NETSP_{c,t}*ef_{cgf}*\\varphi_{NETS,cgf,t}\n\\]\nwhere \\(nct_{cgf,t}\\) and \\(netsp_{cgf,t}\\) stand for the new carbon tax per energy unit and the new ETS price per energy unit, respectively. In both cases, the value per energy unit is obtained based on the national price per ton of \\(CO2\\) (\\(NCT_{c,t}\\) or \\(NETSP_{c,t}\\)), and scaling it by the country-sector-fuel specific emission factors, \\(ef_{cgf,t}\\), and the sector-fuel coverage for the new policies within the country in question (\\(\\varphi_{{NCT},{cgf},t}\\) and \\(\\varphi_{{NETS},{cgf},t}\\)).\nAmong the options available, the user can select the sectors or fuel that will be exempt of the policy implemented, as well as the linear phase out of those exemptions, if selected by the user. This is already considered in the sector-fuel coverage \\(\\varphi\\).\n\nNew excise tax: the user can specify additional per energy unit excise tax in the “Manual inputs” tab.\nFixed/ad-valorem part/other:\n\nIf the country’s taxation regime is “fixed,” this category equals the previous year’s absolute value of the price gap not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax and VAT payment, corrected to price controls.\nIf the taxation regime in the country is “ad-valorem,” this category is equal to the ratio of the previous year’s part of the price gap not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax and VAT payment to the supply cost, multiplied by the current year’s supply cost, corrected to price controls.\n\n\n\\[\nfao_{cgf,t} = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{\\Sigma fao_{cgf,t_0}}{n_{t_0}} &\\text{if fixed}\\\\ \\\\\n\\frac{fao_{cgf,t-1}}{sp_{cgf,t-1}}*sp_{cgf,t} &\\text{if ad-valorem}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Sigma fao_{cgf,t_0} / n_{t_0}\\) represents the average value of \\(fao\\) during the base years.\n\n\n\n3.9.3.4 Power generation costs\nPlease note that the ‘old’ cost model from IMF paper is used only in the elasticity-based power model, and only if ‘Old’ costs are selected (See Figure 3.86).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.86: Generation costs in the elasticity model\n\n\nElasticity-based generation costs are defined as follows. The total unit costs of generation (i.e. for each fuel type considered), \\(gnc_{ocft}\\), is estimated as:\n\\(gnc_{ocft} = efc_{ocft} + nfc_{ocft} + rps_{o,cgft} + nct_{P,cgft}*\\left( 1 - tex_{P,tcft} \\right)\\)\nwhere:\n\n\\(efc_{ocft}\\) denotes the effective fuel unit costs (i.e. after autonomous efficiency gains), which is defined as the retail price before any new policies adjusted from the autonomous efficiency improvement in generation.\n\\(nfc_{ocft}\\) is the effective non-fuel unit costs (i.e. after autonomous efficiency gains). For the base year, non-fuel unit cost is assumed as a fixed proportion through the period of costs that are non-fuel, \\(\\gamma\\):\n\n\\[\n     nfc_{ocf,t_0} = \\frac{efc_{ocf,t_0}}{(1-\\gamma)}*\\gamma\n\\]\n  For the following years, effective non-fuel unit costs are equal to effective non-fuel costs from the previous year, adjusted from the autonomous efficiency improvement.\n\n\\(rps_{o,cgft}\\) denotes the renewable producer subsidies, which only apply to wind, solar, hydro and other renewables.\n\n\n\n3.9.3.5 New price target: Goal seek\nWhen simulating the introduction of a new ETS permit, CPAT allows the user to define, among others, the year of implementation, the initial price/tax to be considered, and the level at which it should reach in a ‘target’ year. While still on a development phase, CPAT incorporates a ‘goal seek’ feature to help the user determine the new policy’s target price based on an goal on the emissions level. \n\n\n\nFigure 3.87: ETS target price - Goal Seek\n\n\n\nLocated to the right of the Advanced Options in the dashboard, the goal seek allows the user to input:\n\nThe sectoral inclusion\nThe proportion of the industrial sector to be covered (if Industry is included)\nThe emissions target (in absolute terms, or the reduction percentage)\n\nThe lower part of the goal seek shows the emissions, by sector, for the baseline and the policy scenarios. The ‘Total’ row shows, first, the aggregated emissions (considering only the sectors included by the user), second, the emissions goal, and third, the squared difference of emissions between the baseline and the policy scenario.\nWhile the user can apply the goal seek functionality in Excel, the algorithm is not particularly useful in this case, and it is more convenient to test the different target prices manually, step-by-step.\nIn brief, once the inputs of the Goal Seek feature are provided, the user should check different alternatives of a target price and evaluate how emissions perform under each one. This simplified tool aims at giving a broad approximation of the price level required to achieve the emissions goal for the target year.\n\n\n\n3.9.4 Appendix D - Examples of NDCs calculations\n\n3.9.4.1 Example 1: Paraguay (BaU NDC)\nNDC overview:\n\nUnconditional target: 10% reduction relative to baseline emissions by 2030\nConditional target: 20% reduction relative to baseline emissions by 2030\nGHG covered: CO2, CH4, N2O\nLULUCF emissions: included\n\nCalculations in CPAT:\n\nBaseline GHGs, excl.

Colombia’s LULUCF emissions are 83.8 MtCO2e, about a half of GHG emissions target in 2030. The harmonized calculations would imply a high burden on energy sector to achieve NDC goals.

    "text": "4.2 Introduction\nCarbon pricing has effects on the baseline GDP growth forecasts. For the reference projection of GDP growth, the user can choose between the World Economic Outlook 2020, the World Economic Outlook 2021, and manually entering the growth forecasts. CPAT adjusts these growth forecasts endogenously depending on different carbon pricing and revenue recycling scenarios. Two channels are captured: First, a carbon tax has both direct and indirect effects on GDP. The latter arises when the carbon tax revenues are recycled as a reduction of other taxes and/or as an increase of government spending. These effects are quantified by the fiscal multipliers. Second, the change in GDP affects energy consumption and, therefore, the effective carbon tax revenues. This is captured by the income elasticities of energy demand.\nRegarding the first channel, an increase in carbon pricing and the subsequent recycling of the carbon tax revenues into higher government spending and/or lower taxes cause GDP to change with the direction and magnitude depending on the respective spending and tax multipliers. For the fiscal multipliers of energy excise taxes (EET), personal income taxes (PIT), sales taxes (VAT), public investment (GIS), public consumption (GCS), and transfers (TRS), CPAT provides four different sources:\n\nIncome group\nGlobal\nManual\nEstimated\n\nMultipliers indicate by how many % GDP responds on impact and in every subsequent year up to a horizon of 10 years to an increase of a fiscal policy instrument by 1% of GDP. The baseline multipliers can be adjusted upwards and downwards by adding/subtracting one empirical standard deviation. This acknowledges the uncertainty around empirical estimates as well as the fact that multipliers tend to be higher during times of economic contraction than expansion. It gives the CPAT user additional flexibility in choosing the appropriate set of multipliers. The present documentation reports the respective methodologies associated with each multiplier source.\nWhen applying fiscal multipliers in CPAT to estimate the GDP effects of a carbon pricing scenario, the following caveats should be noted: First, fiscal multipliers are a link output effects to policy changes in a reduced from. The advantages are that many countries are covered and that values are comparable between countries. Nevertheless, GDP effects of policy interventions may depend on the state of the business cycle and the design of the policy. These are details which multipliers abstract from. Second, income group and global multipliers are derived from an economic model which is empirically estimated. While the model does not impose a strong prior on the multipliers, there is some small remaining influence of the model assumptions on the multipliers. Moreover, the values are averaged over countries because the country-specific multipliers are very volatile. Finally, the estimated multipliers also need to be interpreted with caution. While they are based on a solid dataset and a state-of-the-art methodology, the dataset only includes 75 countries with more than 10 observations. The results have been averaged over various characteristics (see below for details) and extrapolated to countries which are not covered by the data set. Estimating country-specific multipliers is not feasible given the small number of observations for each country."

Details on MFMod can be found in Burns et al. (2019). The model is estimated for each country and country-specific fiscal multipliers are then computed. To ensure robustness and reduce volatility of multipliers across countries, they are averaged over the countries of an income-group. This leads to four sets of multipliers: One set each for high-income countries (HIC), upper middle-income countries (UMIC), lower middle-income countries (LMIC), and low-income countries (LIC).\nMFMod also provides standard errors for these multiplier estimates which are used to adjust the multipliers up- or downwards depending on user preferences."

    "text": "4.6 Estimated multipliers\nEstimated multipliers are obtained from a large panel of high-, middle-, and low-income countries.\n\n4.6.1 Methodology for estimating dynamic multipliers using panel data\nA thorough discussion of the underlying methodology is provided by Schoder (2022) who exploits the global dataset to study how environmental tax multipliers vary over the business cycle. To obtain dynamic multiplier estimates we employ the local projection method proposed by Jordà (2005) and extended to panel data by Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2015) and Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2020). As in Dabla-Norris and Lima (2018), we estimate for every horizon \\(h = 0,1,\\ldots,H - 1\\),\n\\(y_{i,t + h} - y_{i,t - 1} = \\alpha_{i,h} + \\delta_{t,h} + \\text{Δs}_{i,t}\\beta_{h} + \\Delta x_{i,t}\\gamma_{h} + \\epsilon_{t,i,h}\\)\nwhere \\(y_{i,t}\\) is the dependent variable. We are interested in explaining 100 times the log of real per-capita GDP in percent. Note that we are estimating cumulative multipliers. Hence, for each horizon we use the change of these variables relative to \\(t - 1\\) as the dependent variable. \\(s_{i,t}\\) is the identified shock variable. For each tax instrument considered, it is the cyclically adjusted tax revenue-GDP ratio in percent. Hence, \\(\\beta_{h}\\) has the interpretation of a cumulative multiplier. In particular, \\(\\beta_{h}\\) tells us, under the identifying assumption made and discussed below, by how many percent(age-points) output (employment) increases in \\(t + h\\) relative to \\(t - 1\\) if discrete policy increases tax revenues by 1% of GDP. \\(x_{i,t}\\) is a vector of control variables. \\(\\alpha_{i,h}\\) and \\(\\delta_{t,h}\\) are country and time fixed effects, respectively. To account for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation we apply the method proposed by Driscoll and Kraay (1998) for estimating a robust covariance matrix of parameters for a panel model. \\(\\varepsilon_{t,i,h}\\) is the error term.\n\n\n4.6.2 Data set\nTo create the data set, we employ various sources: The OECD PINE data set provides revenue data for total environmental taxes (EVT) and energy taxes (EGT). From UNU WIDER, we take data on personal income taxes (PIT), excise taxes (EXT), value added taxes (VAT), government consumption (GCS), transfer payments (TRS), public investment (GIS). Data on GDP, employment, GDP deflator, government spending, and population are taken from the World Bank’s World Economic Indicators database. We also use data on total final energy consumption, total final diesel consumption, total final gasoline consumption, diesel and gasoline supply prices, and implicit diesel and gasoline tax rates from a data set compiled to inform CPAT. To remove outliers, we cut off the 1% and 99% percentiles of the changes in the tax revenue-GDP ratios.\n\n\n4.6.3 Cyclical adjustment of tax revenues and public spending\nTo address the simultaneous equation bias in the estimates of the tax and spending multipliers which may arise from the feedback of output into tax revenues and spending, we follow the cyclical adjustment approach which assumes that there is a given instrument-specific constant output gap elasticity which can be used to remove the cyclical element from the tax revenues. For instance, the tax revenue-GDP ratios \\(\\frac{T}{Y}\\) have been cyclically adjusted as\n\\(\\frac{T^{*}}{Y^{*}} = \\frac{T}{Y}\\left( \\frac{Y^{*}}{Y} \\right)^{\\eta_{\\text{YT}} - 1}\\)\nwhere \\(Y^{*}\\) is trend GDP obtained from the HP filter of log GDP and \\(\\eta_{\\text{YT}}\\) is the output gap elasticity of the tax revenues. Price, Dang, and Botev (2015) estimated the latter, among other, for PIT, VAT and indirect taxes for OECD countries and Dudine and Jalles (2017) for a large sample of high and low-income countries. For countries without elasticities available, we took the averages as the best guess. Note, that there are no output gap elasticities available for environmental taxes. Hence, for EGT, the output-gap elasticities are estimated following the approach proposed by Price, Dang, and Botev (2015) using total energy consumption as a proxy for the tax base. For the spending instruments, the elasticities have been approximated by the values estimated by Price, Dang, and Botev (2015).\n\n\n4.6.4 Estimation results\nFor each tax and spending instrument and for various subsamples, this section presents the estimation results which, in the subsequent section, are used to compute country-specific multipliers. Note that in this section tax multipliers are not taken as the negative.\nEstimates for the multipliers at horizons larger than eight are restricted to zero when the standard errors become very large, and the sign of the estimate contradicts economic theory. This is to reduce the noise captured by the estimates for larger forecast horizons.\nThe following tables report the fiscal multipliers from the year of the policy change until 10 years after. The multiplier for each horizon indicates the percentage change of GDP (relative to the year before the policy change) in response to a permanent increase in the policy instrument by 1% of GDP.\n\n4.6.4.1 Pooled panel\nGCS

Computation of country specific dynamic multipliers\nIn the final step, the raw multipliers for the pooled panel and various subsamples which are reported above are processed to compute country-specific dynamic multipliers for up to 10 years ahead. To obtain country-specific multipliers, we take a weighted average over the respective multipliers from each sample/subsample which the country is part of.\nThe construction of the weights follows this reasoning: The effective sample size decreases with the length of the estimation horizon. Hence, the longer the multiplier horizon, the more likely the estimate is blurred by noise. This is especially true for the sub-samples as they have fewer observations than the full sample in the first place. To account for this, the weights for the contribution to the multiplier average of the pooled estimates start from zero but increase linearly with the multiplier horizon.\nSince, the multipliers for the spending categories (GCS, GIS, TRS) are not very volatile across horizons or across subsamples (especially at short horizons), we assign relatively more weight to the subsamples compared to the panel.

    "section": "5.1 Introduction",
    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nIncome inequality, poverty and, more generally, social justice considerations are increasingly becoming a centerpiece of governments’ fiscal policy decisions. With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to sharp increases in inequality and poverty, distributional considerations have become even more relevant to decision-makers. In the realm of environmental fiscal reforms, equity and poverty concerns often receive more political attention than in the context of ‘traditional’ fiscal reforms. Public acceptance is strongly driven by reforms’ perceived fairness and impact on low-income households (Klenert et al. (2018); Baranzini et al. (2017)).\nThe Distribution Module of CPAT1.0 aims to inform the spread of the immediate fiscal incidence across (vertical distribution) and within (horizontal distribution) income groups, focusing on consumption effects and compensatory schemes. Tax-induced consumer price changes and revenue recycling in the form of direct transfers have been at the center of the literature on fiscal distribution, since such salient, short-term effects are arguably the most relevant from a political economy perspective.1\nThe Distribution Module allows the user to estimate the carbon tax incidence on consumption, taking into account the direct effect from the use of fuels, as well as the indirect effect from the consumption of other, non-fuel/-energy goods and services. We follow the standard approach in the literature, combining household budget survey (HBS) information with input-output (IO) data, adjusted such that they yield the same effective carbon price revenues as the ones produced by the Mitigation Module (see Hubacek et al. (2017); Olivier and Ruggeri Laderchi (2018); Vogt-Schilb et al. (2019); Schaffitzel et al. (2020); and Dorband et al. (2019)). Country-fuel-sector- price increases are based on scenario-specific estimates from CPAT’s Mitigation Module. Further, the user is provided with two options to relax the typical IO assumptions of full cost-push impacts and absence of behavioral adjustments. Additionally, there is one option to rebate the price increases of a country’s primary cooking fossil fuel to selected bottom deciles to help prevent them from switching to biomass. Results from the Distribution Module have been cross-checked and verified against peer-reviewed country case studies (Silva Freitas et al. (2016); Farrell (2017); Wier et al. (2005); Jiang and Shao (2014); and sterner2012fuel). See Table 5.5.\nFour modes of direct and indirect transfer schemes can be simulated, once the user inputs the share of revenues allocated under each scheme type: i) new or existing targeted transfers (for which the user can decide the targeted percentiles, among other features); ii) transfers towards public investment in infrastructure access; and iii) scaling up an existing social protection scheme (following the targeting of the initial scheme)), and iv) reforming countries’ personal income tax (PIT) schemes. The revenue amounts available for redistribution are based on scenario-specific estimates from the Mitigation Module. New or existing targeted transfers are universal among the targeted percentiles, while infrastructure transfers are targeted to those households without initial access to clean water, affordable electricity, clean sanitation, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), or public transport, based on HBS microdata. Revenue recycling that increases current public spending is proportional to the existing social protection schemes, such as social assistance, insurance, or in-kind benefit schemes. Further to the above, transfer scheme targeting is also available for decile-specific population shares that are below international poverty lines (incomes of 1.9 or 3.2 2011 PPP USD/day) via “poverty-conditional cash transfers”.\nBoth negative consumption effects as well as positive compensation scheme effects are expressed as shares of pre-reform consumption and in absolute, per-capita monetary terms on a decile level, separately for the rural, urban, and overall (or national) populations.2 For vertical distribution graphs, the user can further choose between decile mean and median consumption data inputs. Horizontal distribution between the 25th and 75th percentile of consumption data inputs within each decile is available for consumption effects (both absent as well as net of compensation schemes).\n\n5.1.1 Summary: Distribution Module Overview\n\n5.1.1.1 Problem definition and approach\nBoth taxation and spending policies may aim to redistribute in a way that post-tax income equality is ameliorated relative to pre-tax income equality, often with a special emphasis on the poorest segments of the population. Thus, the progressivity or regressivity (that is, the vertical incidence of fiscal policy options across income groups) are policy-relevant considerations. In addition, horizontal distribution (i.e., distribution within the same income group) has gained increasing attention, as the within-income-group spread of the incidence (expressed as a share of consumption) has been found to be potentially larger than the spread of incidence across income groups due to heterogeneous socioeconomic conditions (Fischer and Pizer (2019)). Horizontal distributional policy analysis is of particular interest with respect to political economy as well as poverty considerations. Identifying the parts of the population which will benefit/pay the most, relative to their income, is crucial to designing and evaluating any tax or social assistance scheme.\nWe measure distributional effects of both tax incidence and revenue recycling in a narrow monetary sense, proxied by relative changes in consumption. Our estimates overstate the negative taxation effects, while understating the positive effects of climate change mitigation and compensation measures. Specifically, the tax incidence analysis focuses on the consumption channel, disregarding structural effects on wages and overall employment, which may positively outweigh consumption-side effects, as they tend to be positive, larger and progressive (Markandya et al. (2016); Metcalf (2019)). In addition, we disregard the large health co-benefits from improved air and environmental quality as well as reduced traffic accidents, road damage and congestion (please, refer to Technical Appendices of Air Pollution and Transport Modules for further details).\nCPAT’s proposed compensation schemes can facilitate the reduction of more fundamental inequalities, due to their economic co-benefits of improved health, education, and opportunity. in this sense, proxying compensation scheme benefits to households by using their monetary amounts is an underestimate of said benefits. For example, sustained conditional cash transfer programs to poorer households can significantly improve child health and educational outcomes and, thus, promote the formation of human capital (Cahyadi et al. (2020)). Unconditional cash transfers to the ultra-poor can accelerate the energy transition to cleaner fuels and reduce energy poverty (Aung et al. (2021)). Increasing the quality and quantity of and access to infrastructure has been found to significantly reduce income inequality, poverty and to accelerate growth (Calderon and Servén (2004)). Furthermore, scaled-up social protection measures and access to clean sanitation or clean energy can have similar positive, long-term effects regarding development and human capital outcomes. Finally, improving PIT progressivity has been associated with lower levels of income inequality (Gerber et al. (2020)).\n\n\n5.1.1.2 Functionalities\nCPAT’s Distribution Module enables ex-ante analyses necessary for informed decision making with respect to how equitable and pro-poor environmental fiscal reform packages would be across countries. As there is no “one-size-fits-all” fiscal reform, the user can choose between several policy design options, particularly with respect to distributional implications within and across household income groups.\nThe Distribution Module includes the following features:\nTax incidence:\n\nConsumption effect (from direct and indirect energy consumption)\nAdjustments to consumption effect:\n\nMitigation-adjusted tax incidence (“behavioral and structural change”)\n“Emissions-based adjustment of product price changes” (implied revenues on households from IO data consistent with calculated revenues in Mitigation Module)\nReduced cost pass-through (of energy price increases)\nBehavioral adjustments, considering consumption decile-specific price elasticities of demand\nSpecial tax rebate for poor households: exemption of cooking fuels\n\n\nCompensatory scheme incidence:\n\nVarious transfer schemes:\n\nTargeted transfers (new or existing social protection scheme(s))\nPublic investment (in infrastructure access spending – e.g., toward SDGs, proxied as cash\n\nCurrent (non-targeted) spending (e.g., scaling up existing social protection scheme(s))Choice of receiving income percentiles and precision of targeting under “Targeted transfers”\nCash transfers to people below poverty line: targeting of decile-specific population that is below international poverty lines (incomes of 1.9 or 3.2 2011 PPP USD/day)\nReduction in PIT liabilities\n\nSocioeconomic heterogeneity: results using median/mean HBS decile-level data, across overall, rural and urban (sub-)samples, horizontal/vertical distribution of effects, consumption effects absent (and net of) compensation schemes Some features may not be available for all countries covered, due to data-related availability constraints. The Distribution sheet in CPAT lists the countries available in the Module. .\nThe full Guiding Package for CPAT microdata harmonization, i.e. for preparing a country’s household microdata for inclusion in the Distribution Module, includes a Codebook, supplementary Guidebook, as well as two coding templates (in STATA format) containing data harmonization, preparation and cleaning processes, and can be provided upon request."

    "section": "5.2 Household budget survey preparation",
    "text": "5.2 Household budget survey preparation\nEstimations of the distribution of carbon tax burdens as well as revenue recycling scheme benefits are largely based on microdata in the form of national household budget surveys (HBSs). This section describes how the primary household-level data are harmonized and aggregated before they are incorporated into CPAT.\n\n5.2.1 Household budget shares\n\\(\\pi^{\\text{dg}}\\) is the budget share of expenditures on a given, category \\(g\\) item by a household in decile \\(d\\). It represents the consumption as observed in a survey year in a specific country. Household consumption shares are processed from HBSs, which are country-specific and heterogenous in terms of structure and coverage. Where possible, CPAT aims to incorporate the latest HBS of the country. This section describes how these shares are calculated.\nFirst \\(C_{j}^{g}\\), household \\(j\\)’s annual consumption on expenditure category \\(g\\), is estimated from HBSs. There are two types of expenditure categories: i) direct fuel/energy consumption expenditures: electricity, natural gas, gasoline, diesel, coal, oil/lubricants, LPG, kerosene, charcoal, ethanol and firewood (listed in Figure 5.1) and ii) non-direct fuel/energy consumption expenditure3: appliances, chemicals, clothing, communications, education, food, health services, housing, paper, pharmaceuticals and medicine, recreation and tourism, transportation equipment, public transportation, and other expenditures Table 5.2. Expenditure items in household surveys are mapped to these CPAT expenditure categories4 and aggregated to create household consumption under said categories.\nIn addition to budget shares, CPAT captures households’ poverty status with respect to the PPP USD 2011 1.9 and 3.2 daily poverty lines. Dummy variables indicate position with respect to the poverty line(s) based on households’ per capita total consumption including actual (not imputed) rent. Poverty incidence is then summed by decile and informs poverty-conditional cash transfers CPAT.\nSubsequently, household budget shares \\(\\pi_{j}^{g}\\) are calculated for each household \\(j\\) from by dividing each household’s consumption of each expenditure category \\(g\\) by total household consumption (\\(C_{j}\\)). Total consumption (for the purposes of budget share estimation) is the sum of consumption in all expenditure categories g, where the category “housing” (see Table 5.2) does not include imputed rent of a dwelling.5\n\\[\\pi_{j}^{g} = \\frac{C_{j}^{g}}{C_{j}} = \\frac{C_{j}^{g}}{\\sum C_{j}^{g}} \\tag{5.1}\\]\nHousehold budget shares \\(\\pi_{j}^{g}\\) are aggregated at the household per-capita consumption decile to arrive at \\(\\pi^{\\text{dg}}\\). Household per-capita consumption-based decile generation (as well as any associated percentile statistics) are weighed by the corresponding survey per-capita population weights (\\(popw\\)) to ensure sample representativeness at the national level. Household per-capita consumption (\\(cons\\_ pc)\\) for the purposes of decile generation is total household consumption including imputed rent (\\(tot\\_cons\\)) divided by household size (\\(hhsize\\)): \\(cons\\_ pc = tot\\_cons/hhsize\\). Following the literature, CPAT, thus, proxies lifetime income, or standard of living, with consumption expenditures, as they are widely considered a better proxy for welfare than nominal (e.g., wage) income (Deaton (1997)).\n\\(\\pi^{\\text{dg}}\\) is estimated for the overall (i.e., national) sample of households as well as separately for urban and rural households. In addition to average household budget shares, the median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile statistics are generated for all three samples (overall, urban and rural) at the decile level.\nOutlier treatment: Any non-missing consumption shares that lie above three (3) standard deviations (SD) of their corresponding (popw-weighted) means in each specific expenditure category are treated as outliers. The outliers are replaced, by decile, with the decile’s popw-weighted mean household consumption share in the specific expenditure category.\nDecile sensitivity check: Household per-capita consumption deciles are based on total household consumption, including imputed rent. The sensitivity of these deciles is checked against the number of households shifting deciles when total household consumption is defined as excluding any rent (tot_cons_norent in 1).\n\n\n5.2.2 Household infrastructure access\nIn addition to household budget shares, indicators for household access to infrastructure are generated and used within CPAT. \\(\\digamma^{\\text{di}}\\) is the weighted share of households (in percent) within decile d which have access to infrastructure category i. These categories are access to i) water; ii) electricity; iii) sanitation; iv) ICT; and v) public transportation (listed and defined in Table 5.3 under “infrastructure access”).\nFirst, \\(\\digamma_{j}^{i}\\), a binary variable taking the value of 1 if a household has access to infrastructure category I (0 otherwise), is generated for each household j in the HBS. Next, \\(\\digamma^{\\text{di}}\\), the popw-weighted average share of \\(\\digamma_{j}^{i}\\) , is calculated for each decile. Note that, since weights are per capita weights, infrastructure access shares represent individuals (not households). Shares are calculated for the overall, urban, and rural sub-samples."

    "section": "5.3 Microsimulation Method",
    "text": "5.3 Microsimulation Method\nCPAT’s Distribution Module enables ex-ante analysis of distributional effects of user-defined environmental fiscal reform packages, focusing on consumption effects and compensatory schemes (see Figure 5.1 for an overview). Section 5.3.1 outlines the carbon tax incidence analysis, Section 5.3.2 presents further options with regard to tax incidence estimates; Section 5.4 introduces the estimation of compensatory schemes, including transfers and reductions in PIT liabilities.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Overview of the deployed microsimulation approach and respective functionalities. Note: for the first step (calculating direct and indirect energy consumption), please refer to Section 5.2 Household data preparation.\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Tax incidence analysis\nCPAT assesses the consumption incidence of carbon fiscal policies across different income groups by means of a microsimulation model. Consumption effects are measured as the costs of maintaining pre-reform consumption (i.e., households’ additional expenditures), observed from country-level HBS data, with the user-defined carbon tax scenario in place. Thus, this microsimulation focuses on the short-term consumption changes in terms of compensating variation, assuming fixed consumption patterns. In other words, households are assumed not to adjust their behavior in response to the carbon price, and consumption effects represent upper-bound estimates (Dorband et al 2019). Estimating price and income elasticities of demand, differentiated across countries, income levels and energy/non-energy products is a data- and resource-intensive task, which can be partly integrated into the analysis via a user option to apply decile-specific price elasticities of demand (based on USDA data6) to said microsimulation estimates (see also Section 5.3.2).\nThe consumer incidence of an energy-based upstream carbon tax is determined by the tax-induced price changes of fossil fuels, as well as by the direct and indirect energy consumption bundles of households; that is, by households’ direct fuel combustion or use of electricity, and the indirect consumption of energy embedded in other goods and services. Thus, the proportion of additional expenditures P of individual j after the policy intervention is a multiplicative function of (i) average energy intensities \\(\\overline{e_{\\text{fg}}}\\) (USD/USD) of fuel f of consumption items from each sector g (note that f ∈ g); (ii) total expenditures \\(C\\); and (iii) the tax rate t for fuel f in sector g, expressed as the price increase post- (p2) relative to pre-reform (p1) (USDp2/USDp1) (c.f. endnote 3).\n\\[p_{j} = \\sum_{\\text{fg}}p_{\\text{fgj}}  = \\frac{\\sum_{\\text{fg}}{\\overline{e_{\\text{fg}}}\\ *t_{\\text{fg}}* C_{\\text{gj}}}}{C_{j}} \\;\\; , f \\in g \\tag{5.2}\\]\nThe tax-induced price changes of fossil fuels (c.f. Table 5.1 for a list of fuels), which determine households’ additional expenditures on direct fuel consumption (for f=g, in Equation 5.3), are a function of fuels’ carbon intensities, \\(e_{f}\\), measured by emissions factors, and pre-existing price distortions in the Mitigation Module. For each user-defined carbon fiscal scenario, price changes are obtained from the Mitigation Module (see respective Mitigation Module Documentation). As price increases vary for each fuel by sector (due to varying emissions factors and baseline pricing), price changes are estimated for each country, year and fuel-sector pair \\(t_{\\text{fg}}\\), where “sectors” here are power, industry, and residential. Residential sector fuel price changes are used to calculate the direct consumption effects.\nThe tax-induced price changes of goods and services based on the domestic carbon price, which determine households’ additional expenditures on indirect fuel consumption (for f ∉ g, in Equation 5.3), follow a standard input-output (IO) approach. Consistent with much of the carbon tax literature, all price increases resulting from the user-defined carbon fiscal reform are expected to be fully passed forward, from producers and suppliers to final consumers. Estimated consumer price increases are, thus, absolute upper bounds.7 Adapted from basic IO analyses (cf. Leontief (1986); Minx et al. (2009)), household energy intensities \\(\\overline{e_{g}}\\) result as entries of the vector:\n\\[e_{g} = f\\left( I - A \\right)^{- 1}, \\; f \\notin g \\tag{5.3}\\]\nwhere each fossil fuel sector, f is a vector assigning an energy intensity coefficient to each non-fuel sector. The \\(( I - A )^{- 1}\\) matrix, or Leontief inverse (cf. Leontief, 1986), accounts for all upstream inputs that are required to produce one unit of final demand for each sector. \\(I\\) is the identity matrix and \\(\\text{A\\ }\\)is a normalized matrix of technical coefficients based on inter-sectoral commodity flows.\nFor (IO) data, we use the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP-10), (Aguiar et al. (2019)) to compute fossil fuel/energy intensities, and respective price changes for non-fuel sectors. The GTAP-10 database has several advantages. First, it is a consistent global database which harmonizes and scales data for 65 disaggregated sectors (g) and 141 world regions to the year 2014. Such harmonized data improve comparability across country-specific results in CPAT. Important for the estimation of sectoral effects from country-fuel-sector price changes is that GTAP-10 provides a more granular disaggregation of energy sectors than other global IO data with similar regional coverage (e.g., EORA). Yet, while CPAT distinguishes between eight fossil fuel/energy carriers, GTAP-10 includes only five fossil fuel sectors and electricity. Based on the concordance table, for GTAP’s “Petroleum and coke products” (p_c) sector, CPAT calculates the weighted average price change, using the economy-wide fuel use volumes of these products (in ktoe from IEA 2020) as weights.\n\n\nTable 5.1: Concordance table of CPAT fossil fuels (with acronyms) to GTAP-10 fossil fuel sectors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPAT fossil fuel (f)\nGTAP10 sector (f)\n\n\nCoal (coa)\ncoa\n\n\nElectricity (ely)\nely\n\n\nNatural gas (nga)\ngas/gdt\n\n\nOther oil products (oop)\noil\n\n\nGasoline (gso)\n\n\n\np_c\n\n\nDiesel (die)\n\n\nLPG (lpg)\n\n\nKerosene (ker)\n\n\n\n\nFinally, sectoral energy intensities, \\(e_{g}\\), and household expenditures, \\(C_{\\text{gj}}\\), are produced for 14 indirect fuel consumption categories. Household consumption is computed as described in Section 5.2 from primary HBS data. Individual consumer items reported in the surveys are mapped to the respective GTAP sectors, which, in turn, are mapped to the 14 consumption categories (c.f. Table 5.1 for concordance between categories and sectors). Thus, all of the 59 non-energy GTAP sectors, which produce end-consumer goods and services, are aggregated into 14 average product categories. Groupings are determined on the grounds of comparable average levels of energy-intensity, as well as to match IEA sectoral definitions used in CPAT. For a complete concordance table among relevant sources of data, please, refer to CPAT’s ‘Mapping’ tab. Thus, for each GTAP fuel sector, \\(f\\), energy intensities, \\(e_{g}\\) in Equation 5.3, of the 14 CPAT consumption categories, g, are a weighted average of the energy intensities of the respective non-fuel GTAP sectors, weighted by GTAP’s household final demand vector, \\(Y\\).\nThe CPAT Distribution Module is an improvement over the standard approach in the literature. CPAT explicitly models a domestic carbon price reform. This means, Leontiefs between fossil fuels and sectors of production reflect only the domestically burned fuels. ‘Embedded’ fuel inputs in imports are not considered in the carbon price-induced price change of goods and services. Particularly in countries with high shares of imports in the goods and services consumed domestically, this approach may yield lower, but more accurate, results on consumption incidence.\n\n\n5.3.2 Optional features for tax incidence analysis\n\n5.3.2.1 Mitigation-adjusted tax incidence\nThe Module provides the user with an option to roughly assess how the consumption effects would decrease if emissions reductions induced by the carbon price reform were taken into account. This adjustment scales down overall consumer price increases relative to the scheme’s mitigation effect, thus relaxing the cost-push assumption. The Mitigation Module provides estimates of economy-wide GHG emissions reductions and tax revenues from carbon taxation over time. As noted above, the sectorally more disaggregated Distribution Module is based on IO Leontief production functions. This assumes fixed technical coefficients and, thus, full price pass-through, such that the estimated tax incidence is to be understood as an absolute upper bound, or short-term, estimate. CPAT provides the user with an approximate measure of the extent to which consumption effects would decrease if behavioral responses and structural change were accounted for: for the (future) year of interest, CPAT compares the tax revenue estimates of the elasticities-driven Mitigation Module with the tax revenues of the IO-based Distribution Module8, i.e. the proportion of revenues raised after and before taking into account behavioral responses:\nLet the economy-wide tax burden, or total tax revenues, estimated in the Mitigation Module be \\(P_{M}^{y}\\) for year y, and in the Distribution Module be \\(P_{D}^{y}\\) (\\(P_{M}^{y} &lt; P_{D}^{y}\\)), where:\n\\[P_{D} = \\sum_{j}{p_{j}*C_{j}} \\tag{5.4}\\]\nrepresents the total revenues expected based on representative HBS consumption data Cj. As survey data aggregates usually do not match national accounts, and as total revenues should compare for the year of interest in the simulation, CPAT scales \\(P_{D}\\) to match the national accounts in the year of interest y (2022 \\(\\leq\\) y \\(\\leq\\) 2030), such that:\n\\[P_{D}^{y} = P_{D}* \\frac{\\text{GDP}^{y}*\\theta_{c}}{\\sum C_{j}} \\tag{5.5}\\]\nwhere GDPy represents the expected GDP in the year of interest in the simulation and \\(\\theta_{c}\\) represents the final consumption expenditure to GDP ratio for the latest available year from World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database.9 Then, the downward adjustment factor to the tax incidence on consumers, \\(p_{\\text{Adj}}\\) follows as:\n\\[p_{\\text{Adj}} = \\frac{P_{D}^{y} - P_{M}^{y}}{P_{D}^{y}} \\; , \\;P_{M}^{y} &lt; P_{D}^{y} \\tag{5.6}\\]\nThe adjustment factor \\(p_{\\text{Adj}}\\) is applied homogenously across the population, represented as a positive relative consumption effect in CPAT. This approach will be refined in subsequent versions of CPAT: estimating with more precision the distributional effects of relaxing the assumption of full pass-through of tax-induced price changes to the end-consumer requires sophisticated data on production- and consumption-side energy price elasticities. Within countries, households of different income strata consume different product bundles (as discussed in the extensive literature on Engel Curves). Thus, for a thorough distributional analysis one needs to determine: a) how price elasticities vary across sectors/products; and b) how price elasticities of demand for products vary with income.\n\n\n5.3.2.2 Decile-specific price elasticities of demand\nCPAT allows the user to model short-term adjustments on the demand side alone, using decile-, country-, and item-specific price elasticities of demand based on (Muhammad et al., 2011). The price elasticities provided are by country and consumption category (COICOP), as well as for high, middle and low income countries. Based on standard concordance tables (ISIC Rev. 4 and CPC 2.1), CPAT maps the elasticities to CPAT consumption categories. CPAT, then, adopts the countries’ elasticity reported for the middle deciles and assumes that the upper and lower deciles’ elasticities will deviate from the elasticity reported by the same proportion as the elasticities for low- and high-income countries deviate from that of middle-income countries for each consumption item. Following the same approach as in the Mitigation Module, the country-decile-specific price elasticity of demand for consumption category g, \\({\\epsilon_{\\text{use}}}^{g}\\) is changing \\(C_{j}^{g}\\) as follows:\n\\[C_{j}^{g}* \\left( \\frac{p_{t}}{p_{t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{\\text{use}}} \\tag{5.7}\\]\n\n\n5.3.2.3 Imperfect pass-through\nCPAT also provides the user with the option to allow producers to absorb, i.e. not “pass through”, part of the tax-induced price increase. There is ample evidence that (irrespective of any fuel saving/switching behavior) firms pass forward only a portion of the tax-induced energy price increase (Ganapati, Shapiro, and Walker (2020); Abdallah and Le (2020)). The Distribution Module differentiates pass-through coefficients for 14 transport and industrial sectors, with coefficients ranging from 0.7 to 0.9, and averaging 0.8. Coefficients \\(\\gamma_{g}\\) \\((\\gamma_{g} \\leq 1)\\) are applied to the tax rate \\(t\\) for sector \\(g\\), expressed as the price increase post- relative to pre-reform* 10 , such that the downward-adjusted energy price change \\({t}_{\\text{fg}}^{*}\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[t_{\\text{fg}}^{*} = t_{\\text{fg}}*\\gamma_{g} \\tag{5.8}\\]\n\n\n5.3.2.4 Emissions-based adjustment of sectoral price changes\nAs described above, the incidence of goods’ and services’ price changes on consumers is based on GTAP-related fuel-sector Leontiefs. Multiplying the Leontief with the respective fuel’s price change, we obtain ‘indirect’ consumer price changes (in the static option). This multiplication implicitly introduces a price assumption to the GTAP monetary flow of energy: based on observed fuel prices (USD/volume or weight of fuel in 2021), the Mitigation Module estimates expected fuel price changes. Thus, this calculation assumes a corresponding energy flow. However, this energy flow might not necessarily match the observed energy flow by fuel and sector (which CPAT takes from IEA Energy Balances). To correct for this potential imbalance, CPAT allows the user to adjust consumer price incidence by theoretical time-zero revenue flows from the carbon pricing reform modelled. This means that, using the best available empirical data (IEA Energy Balances, GAINS emissions factors, and IMF combined fuel price data), CPAT calculates the revenues that would be raised if no price-induced adjustments were to take place – hence the term time-zero revenues. These theoretical revenue streams are calculated by fuel and CPAT sector. The final demand portion of this price incidence on the economy (usually around 60%, as the remainder is accounted for by goods which are exported or consumed by government and fixed capital formation) is equivalent to the static consumption incidence which should be reflected in the analysis. CPAT, thus, allows the user to scale the baseline incidence to this level. If chosen, additional adjustments are, then, calculated using this new baseline.\n\n\n5.3.2.5 Cooking-fuel adjusted tax incidence\nFor selected deciles (starting from the poorest one), CPAT provides the user with the option to exclude from taxation the fossil fuel which is used as a primary cooking fuel. The rationale is as follows: when taxing primary cooking fuels (e.g., LPG), there may be a risk of households being pushed into using traditional, unsustainable biomass (e.g., firewood or charcoal). Therefore, the user can model distributional effects of carbon taxes when households in the bottom (e.g., one or two) deciles do not face an increase in the price of their primary cooking fossil fuel. From a policy design standpoint, this option is to be understood as a rebate. That is, the household will pay the tax when buying the fuel but will receive a compensatory transfer for its cooking needs. Such rebate schemes have received particular attention during India’s LPG subsidy reform, which implemented the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme for LPG (“Pratyaksha Hastaantarit Laabh (PAHAL)”) program.11\nPrimary cooking fossil fuels are identified for each country based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Household Energy Database12. Covering 161 countries, the database collects and harmonizes household survey data on the portion of the population cooking with each of fourteen disaggregated fuels, considering surveys between 1970-2014. For each country, and the latest available year of survey data, CPAT determines which of the eight fossil fuels listed in Table 5.1 is most widely used for cooking."

    "section": "5.4 Incidence of compensatory transfers",
    "text": "5.4 Incidence of compensatory transfers\nGiven countries’ heterogeneous development status, and political and socioeconomic realities, the design of environmental fiscal reforms varies widely. CPAT provides the user with various options for recycling revenues from environmental fiscal policy scenarios, including via direct and indirect support schemes. Direct transfer schemes to households provide a particularly suitable instrument for increasing public acceptance of tax reforms. This is because they are salient, immediate, and well-targetable. Additionally, direct transfer programs are widely adopted globally, as they have proven to be an effective means of achieving key development goals, with some of them being more administratively simple to implement, due to digitization.\nIn CPAT, the user can choose among three general options for redistribution via transfers to households. All three redistribution options are modelled as direct, per capita payments averaged by deciles:\n\nDecile-targeted transfers (new or existing social protection scheme(s))\nPublic investment (in infrastructure access)\nCurrent spending (e.g., scaling up existing social protection scheme(s))\nLabor tax reforms (as personal income tax reforms)\n\n\n5.4.1 Targeted and infrastructure-based transfers\nBeyond the choice among (a)-c) above), the following four parameters are user-defined:\n\nthe percentage share of total revenues to be used for (new, existing) targeted and/or public spending transfers;\n(for new/existing targeted transfers only) the per capita income percentiles to receive the chosen transfer (starting from the bottom of the income distribution; \\((C_{jT} \\leq p(T) C_j)\\);\n(for new/existing targeted transfers only) the “coverage rate”, i.e. the share of the population targeted actually receiving the transfer; and\n(for new/existing targeted transfers only) the “leakage rate”, i.e. the share of the untargeted population receiving the transfer.\n\nOptions 3. and 4. allow the user to consider imperfect implementation of cash transfer schemes, such that parts of the population which would qualify for the transfer do not receive it, while other parts of the population (not qualifying) do so, due to imperfect targeting. Such leakage is assumed to be spread equally across the non-targeted population.\nThe amount of the targeted, per capita transfer, T, for the targeted population, popT, is calculated by dividing total transferred revenues by the total eligible or ‘targeted’ population in the year of interest y, such that:\n\\[T^{y} = \\frac{P_{M}^{y}}{\\text{pop}_{T}^{y}} \\tag{5.9}\\]\nWhere the survey population (i.e., the sum of per capita population weights)13 is scaled to match the projected national accounts, \\(pop\\), based on the IMF’s 2022 World Economic Outlook vintage, for the year of interest, such that:\n\\[\\text{pop}^T_y = (\\sum \\text{popw}_{T})* \\theta_{\\text{pop}}^{y} \\tag{5.10}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\\theta_{\\text{pop}}^{y} = \\frac{\\text{pop}^{y}}{\\sum\\text{popw}} \\tag{5.11}\\]\nNew targeted transfers are conditional on per capita consumption (user-choice 2. above). Thus, the average per capita transfer, \\(T_{d}^{y}\\), for decile d depends on the portion of the decile population, \\(\\text{pop}_{T}^{\\text{dy}}\\) , below the targeted consumption threshold (i.e. for which \\(C_{jT} \\leq p(T) C_j\\)) such that:\n\\[T_{d\\ }^{y} = \\ T^{y}*\\frac{\\sum \\text{pop}_{T}^{\\text{dy}}}{\\sum \\text{pop}^{\\text{dy}}} \\tag{5.12}\\]\nTransfers toward infrastructure access are received only by those individuals without initial access to infrastructure type i, \\(\\digamma_{j}^{i}\\) (refer to Section 5.2 for details). The user can choose between five different types of infrastructure provision: CPAT defines infrastructure access in line with the WHO’s WASH database14 and WB WDI database indicators as follows:\n\nAccess to improved water source: piped water on premises (piped household water connection located inside the user’s dwelling, plot or yard), other improved drinking water sources public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected dug wells, protected springs, and rainwater collection\nAccess to improved sanitation facilities: flush/pour flush (to piped sewer system, septic tank, pit latrine), ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine, pit latrine with slab, and composting toilet\nAccess to electricity: household connection to local/village/national grid/network; not: battery, generator, PV system\nAccess to information & communication technology (ICT): ownership of mobile phone/computer, household internet access\nAccess to public transport\n\nThe portion of the decile population, \\(\\text{pop}_{T}^{\\text{dy}}\\), receiving the transfer, as per Equation 5.12 is calculated based on the weighted share of households in decile d who have access to infrastructure category i, \\(\\digamma^{\\text{di}}\\), such that\n\\[\\text{pop}_{\\text{Ti}}^{\\text{dy}} = \\sum_{d = 1}^{10}\\text{pop}^{\\text{dy}}*(1 - \\digamma^{\\text{di}}) \\tag{5.13}\\]\n\n\n5.4.2 Transfers through existing social protection schemes\nPolicy makers may favor extending existing social safety nets for the transfer of carbon tax revenues to households. CPAT, thus, provides the option to proportionally scale up existing social protection schemes, based on the Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience and Equity (ASPIRE) dataset. For 104 countries, ASPIRE provides quintile-level estimates of per capita transfers received through various benefit schemes, including social assistance measures such as targeted subsidies, in-kind assistance and existing cash transfer programs, labor market protection schemes as well as social insurance (please, refer to the ASPIRE documentation for a full catalog of covered schemes by country15).\nAs CPAT simulates a proportional scaling of existing schemes, it first determines the proportion \\(\\mathrm{\\Delta}A\\) by which the protection scheme a can be scaled up. Following Equation 5.9 above, CPAT defines:\n\\[{\\mathrm{\\Delta}A}_{a}^{y} = \\frac{P_{M}^{y}}{A_{a}^{y}} \\tag{5.14}\\]\nwhere \\(A_{a}^{y}\\) is the inflation-adjusted total government spending on protection scheme a in the year of interest y. For calculating total government spending, CPAT first multiplies per capita quintile transfer amounts by a fifth of the population popy in the year of interest y, to arrive at total spending by quintile, which is, then, summed up. CPAT arrives at average decile transfers assuming that every two deciles receive the same amount (in per capita terms) as their corresponding quintile (e.g., deciles 1 and 2 receive the per-capita transfer of quintile 1 and so on). The approach described here (in tandem with options 1-4 listed under Section 5.4.1 above) also applies when users choose to recycle carbon tax revenues via existing (as opposed to new) targeted transfers.\n\n\n5.4.3 Carbon Price Revenue Recycling via Personal Income Tax Reductions\n\n5.4.3.1 Data Requirements and Setup\nThe distributional effects of carbon price (CP) revenue recycling via personal income tax (PIT) reductions depend on the baseline PIT liabilities of individuals at different segments of the income distribution. Broadly speaking, these liabilities are a function of two components: taxable (i.e., “gross”) income and PIT schedules. To circumvent the modeling of (often complex) PIT systems around the world, CPAT, instead, obtains this information via data on the share of each (disposable, market) income decile’s PIT liabilities in economy-wide PIT liabilities. This information should already account for elements such as, for example, the decile-specific incidence of non-standard PIT regimes, informality, and tax evasion/avoidance, without the need for additional assumptions in this regard.\nDecile-specific shares in aggregate PIT liabilities are based on nominal PIT liability data by decile, which is collected from two main sources. First, CPAT relies on the latest vintage(s) of the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS)16. The LIS contains nationally representative household (HH) survey data on income, demographics and labor market characteristics. Using the LIS, disposable income17 decile-specific, PIT liabilities are, thus, obtained as the HH-weighted sum of the “hxitax” variable18. Second, CPAT also obtains similar data from the latest vintage of the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) “Standard Indicators” database19 for each country. In particular, this database contains information on the incidence (in percent of total market income) of “direct taxes” paid by market income20 decile. From this data, CPAT obtains the decile-specific sum of direct taxes paid. Across both data sources, decile-specific shares of income/direct taxes paid are calculated as the ratios of the decile-specific total tax liabilities to the sum of all tax liabilities across deciles.21 Taking income/direct taxes as a proxy for PIT liability, the above results in a database of PIT liability shares at the country-year-decile level.22 For the purposes of estimation within the CPAT 1.1. Distribution Module, decile-specific PIT liability shares in economy-wide PIT paid are assumed to be constant over time.\nEconomy-wide PIT paid is, subsequently, calibrated to equal the product of: i) the average PIT-to-GDP ratio23 during the period 2010-201924; and ii) GDP in the year of interest for the distributional effects analysis, \\(y\\).\nAnalytically:\n\\(L_{\\text{dcy}} = \\ s_{\\text{dc}}*{AVG\\_ PIT\\_ GDP}_{c}*\\text{RGDP}_{\\text{cy}}\\) and \\(l_{\\text{dcy}} = \\ L_{\\text{dcy}}/P_{\\text{dcy}}\\)\nwhere \\(L_{\\text{dcy}}\\) and \\(l_{\\text{dcy}}\\) stand for the total and per-capita PIT liabilities of decile \\(\\text{d\\ }\\)in country \\(\\text{c\\ }\\)and analysis year \\(y\\). \\({AVG\\_ PIT\\_ GDP}_{2010 - 2019}\\) is the 2010-2019 average PIT-to-GDP ratio for country \\(c\\) (assumed to be constant over time), \\(\\text{RGDP}_{\\text{cy}}\\) is the real GDP in constant 2021 local currency units (LCU) in country \\(\\text{c\\ }\\)and analysis year \\(y\\) and \\(P_{\\text{dcy}}\\) is the total population of decile \\(\\text{d\\ }\\)in country \\(\\text{c\\ }\\)and analysis year \\(y\\). \\(P_{\\text{dcy}}\\) is calibrated to national population in country \\(\\text{c\\ }\\)and analysis year \\(y\\), based on the country-specific population distributions obtained from household budget surveys (HBSs) as part of the data requirements for the CPAT consumption incidence calculations. Finally, \\(s_{\\text{dcy}}\\) is the share of PIT liability of decile \\(\\text{d\\ }\\)in country \\(\\text{c\\ }\\)and analysis year \\(y\\), proxied by data on direct or individual income taxes as described above.\nThe resulting estimates are merged with each country’s, decile-level HBS data for the overall sample25, assuming a 1:1 correspondence between the LIS/disposable income and CEQ/market income deciles and the consumption deciles from the various HBSs. In cases, where LIS and CEQ country coverage overlaps26, CPAT prioritizes the source which covers the latest available year of data27.\n\n\n5.4.3.2 Calculations\nIf the user chooses to recycle a percentage of CP revenues towards “labor tax reductions”, the Distribution Module within CPAT 1.1 estimates resulting per-capita decile-specific gains (in real 2021 LCU) under three (mutually exclusive) PIT liability reduction scenarios:\nTargeted Exemption. Under this scenario, selected HH consumption deciles gain the baseline amount of PIT they pay, conditional on available CP revenues. In other words, the allocation of CP revenues would be such that said deciles would not be liable for PIT. In this case, the per-capita LCU gain \\(g\\) for (HH per-capita consumption) decile \\(\\text{d\\ }\\)in country \\(\\text{c\\ }\\)and analysis year \\(y\\) can be written as:\n\\[g_{dcy\\_ TE} = l_{\\text{dcy}}\\mathbb{I}_{\\lbrack d = exempt\\rbrack} \\mathbb{I}_{\\lbrack 0\\  \\leq remaining\\ CT\\ revenues\\  \\leq l_{\\text{dcy}}\\rbrack}\\]\nwhere \\(l_{\\text{dcy}}\\) stands for the per-capita PIT liability of decile \\(\\text{d\\ }\\)in country \\(\\text{c\\ }\\)and analysis year \\(y\\). \\(\\mathbb{I}_{\\left\\lbrack d = exempt \\right\\rbrack}\\) is an indicator function denoting that decile \\(d\\) has been selected as the decile to be fully exempt from PIT via the use of CP revenues. \\(\\mathbb{I}_{\\lbrack 0\\  \\leq remaining\\ CT\\ revenues\\  \\leq l_{\\text{dy}}\\rbrack}\\) is another indicator function denoting that decile \\(d\\) will only benefit from a full PIT exemption of an amount up to (or less than)\\(\\ l_{\\text{dcy}}\\), provided that a non-zero amount of CP revenues is available for said purpose. It should, thus, be noted that, even if CP revenues are not enough to fully offset the PIT liability of decile \\(d\\) under this scenario, the Distribution Module will still allocate any remaining CP revenue amounts starting from this decile (and moving upwards onto any remaining deciles), provided that these amounts are available to be allocated.\nPersonal Allowance. Under this scenario, PIT liabilities are (in absolute terms) uniformly reduced across the PIT-paying population, similar to a per-capita lump-sum transfer to the working population. The respective (equal, per-capita) gains are calculated by dividing the proportion of CP revenues used for PIT reductions by the sum of all individuals in the country. The calculated amount is the maximum available transfer for PIT reduction purposes. Hence, the per-capita LCU gain \\(g\\) for (HH per-capita consumption) decile \\(\\text{d\\ }\\)in country \\(\\text{c\\ }\\)and analysis year \\(y\\) can be written as:\n\\[g_{dcy\\_ PE} = {min\\{ l_{\\text{dcy}},\\ r}_{\\text{cy}}\\}\\]\nwhere \\(l_{\\text{dcy}}\\) stands for the per-capita PIT liability of decile \\(\\text{d\\ }\\)in country \\(\\text{c }\\)and analysis year \\(y\\). Additionally, \\(r_{\\text{cy}}\\) is the ratio of all available CT revenues to the sum of all individuals in the country and represents the maximum possible mean per-capita gain of a given decile \\(d\\). Decile \\(d\\) is, hence, guaranteed \\(l_{\\text{dcy}}\\) provided that \\(l_{\\text{dcy}} &lt; r_{\\text{cy}}\\). Finally, \\(r_{\\text{cy}}\\) is parametrized such that it reflects use of all CP revenues made available for PIT liability reductions across deciles. Specifically, any remaining revenues following the aforementioned calculations are, once again, equally divided across all individuals in the country and paid out as additional gains under this reform scenario. Since this scenario resembles a lump-sum, per-capita transfer to the working population, gains are likely to be, by default, progressively distributed. This is because transfers tend to represent a larger proportion of poorer households’ incomes.\nProportional Compensation. Under this scenario, each (HH consumption) decile receives an average per-capita gain that increases with the HH’s baseline PIT liability. In other words, the more PIT a decile pays, the higher the gain. Therefore, the per-capita LCU gain \\(g\\) for (HH per-capita consumption) decile \\(\\text{d}\\)in country \\(\\text{c}\\)and analysis year \\(y\\) can be written as:\n\\[g_{dcy\\_ PC} = \\ l_{\\text{dcy}}*f_{\\text{cy}}\\]\nwhere \\(l_{\\text{dcy}}\\) stands for the per-capita PIT liability of decile \\(\\text{d\\ }\\)in country \\(\\text{c\\ }\\)and analysis year \\(y\\). Additionally, \\(f_{\\text{cy}}\\) is a scalar representing the LCU gain from CP revenue recycling per LCU of baseline PIT paid. This is, in turn, calculated as the total LCU amount of available CP revenues divided by the total LCU amount of PIT paid across all deciles. For instance, a value of 0.5 would be interpreted as each HH consumption decile gaining 0.5 LCUs from CP revenue recycling for each LCU of baseline PIT it pays. In general (depending on the distribution and magnitudes of decile-specific PIT liability shares), this scenario results in a relatively more regressive effect of CP revenue recycling across HH consumption deciles.\n\n\n5.4.3.3 Assumptions and Caveats\nThe methodology described here is subject to a series of assumptions and caveats.\n\nThe PIT liability calculations assume away any estimates based on actual fiscal regime data (e.g., detailed modeling of tax credits, surtaxes and potential (sector-specific) deductions, etc.). More importantly, no distinction is made in terms of different types of PIT liabilities (e.g., those for self-employed vs. non-self-employed workers). Said distinction could be crucial in determining heterogeneity in the size and dispersion of PIT reduction gains, given that self-employed workers usually face a different PIT schedule.\nThe PIT liability share calculations also assume that the household survey-type data available via the LIS and CEQ accurately capture the entirety of PIT paid across the income distribution. Ideally, PIT liability calculations would need to draw upon gross income and taxes paid as these are reported in tax return data. However, databases containing such information suffer from sparse country-year coverage and often lack reporting of decile-specific information.28 On a similar note, the “income taxes” and “direct taxes” variables in the LIS and CEQ databases are assumed to be good proxies for the PIT, which might not be the case given other potential taxes that could be captured therein (e.g., capital gains taxes, etc.).\nAny gains from PIT reductions are assumed to be distributed equally across all population sub-groups (i.e., working and non-working individuals, adults and children, men and women, etc.). This is likely to misstate impacts on different deciles to the extent that the demographic composition of population varies substantially across deciles.\nThe data-generating process outlined above assumes perfect correspondence between consumption and income deciles. The individuals within HH consumption decile 1 (per the HBS data) may not be the same as the ones under income decile 1 (per the LIS and CEQ data). This implies a certain degree of inaccuracy in the use of revenue recycling gains from PIT reductions to offset specific consumer surplus losses from a given CP.\nIn keeping with the static, partial equilibrium framework of the Distribution Module within CPAT 1.1, the revenue recycling calculations also assume no changes in PIT payments/compliance in response to the CP scenario analyzed in CPAT 1.1. Relatedly, the calculations also abstract from trends in PIT liability patterns, since decile-specific PIT liability shares and PIT-to-GDP ratios are assumed constant over time.\nThe calculations presented above remain agnostic as to the size and distribution of PIT reduction gains for the urban vs. rural sub-samples in CPAT. To address this issue, CPAT scales any gains by the share of urban and rural population to total population, thus yielding the gains for the urban and rural sub-samples respectively.\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Aggregate and direct fuel consumption expenditure categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable name\nUnit\nDescription\n\n\nAuxiliary & demographic variables\n\n\n\n\nhhid\nSerial number\nUnique household (HH) identifier\n\n\niso3\nISO-3 Code\nCountry ISO-3 code\n\n\nyear\nYear (YYYY)\nHH interview year\n\n\nhhsize\nIndividuals (Count)\nNumber of members per HH\n\n\npopw_hh\nWeight (Count: HHs)\nHH population weight\n\n\npopw\nWeight (Count: National Population per hhid)\nPer-capita population weight (used for binning/deciles);\nnational population represented by each hhid.

    "section": "6.1 Executive summary",
    "text": "6.1 Executive summary\nPolicies aimed to reduce GHG emissions, such as carbon pricing, can lead to a reduction in ambient air pollution, a major health risk1, due to the co-emission of GHGs and local pollutants when burning fossil fuels. Local pollutants, such as BC, OC, NH3, SO2 and NMVOC are responsible for the formation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) pollution, with known health impacts. CPAT quantifies reductions in mortality and morbidity from improved air quality as part of the co-benefits of carbon pricing.\n\nThe air pollution module in CPAT is mostly based on models developed by external institutions and researchers, but also includes modeling developed specifically for CPAT. The main inputs are: (1) energy consumption in time and scenario by fuel type and sector from the Mitigation module, (2) emission factors net of projected average use of pollution control equipment, fuel processing and combustion method from GAINS model2, (3) concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone for the baseline year, (4) emissions-to-concentrations relationships based on source receptor matrices (TM5-FASST), regression analysis, machine learning models, source apportionment studies and intake fractions, (5) relative risk functions3 for exposure to PM2.5 and O3, and (6) population projections in time.\nThe main results from the air pollution module are mortality and disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributed to air pollution (ambient and household) under the baseline and the carbon price scenario. Other outputs include: (1) the economic valuation of averted deaths (using a transferred value of the statistical life), (2) health expenditure, (3) working days lost due to pollution, and (4) market output losses due to morbidity and mortality.\nReduced-form approximations are used to estimate emissions, concentration of pollutants and health effects. We use and adapt the results of more complex models into simplified relationships. For instance, in the case of the relationship between emissions of pollutants and ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone, CPAT includes the option to use the results from a linear emulator of a complex global chemical transport model. The results of the air pollution module are in line with other more complex models (see Section 6.8), although both CPAT and the models to which we compare to are subject to uncertainty and the results may be sensitive to the assumptions used. We address this issue in CPAT by allowing the user to input local information, if available, and to switch among methodological options (with the best options possibly dependent on the country chosen).\n\nCaveats in the air pollution module include the use of international databases, the country level (instead of sub national) and annual resolution of the analysis and the uncertainty on estimations. Section 6.9 provides some insights on how the user can tackle these caveats."

As presented in the figure, the air pollution tab receives as an input the energy consumption for the different sectors and fuels from the Mitigation tab. Emissions (of local and global pollutants) are calculated in the Mitigation tab of CPAT, but the data sources and methodology used is covered in this Chapter. Based on emissions estimates, the Air Pollution tab calculates for each year the concentration of PM2.5 and O3, the health impacts attributed to pollution (deaths and DALYs) and economic impacts of pollution.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Overview of CPAT methodology\n\n\nThe health impacts attributable to air pollution methodology is presented in Figure 6.2. As shown in the figure, the total health burden of pollution is estimated for the baseline scenario and for the carbon price scenario. The impact of the carbon price is then estimated as the difference between the total burden under both scenarios.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Methodology for estimating health impacts of a carbon price\n\n\nThe methodological steps presented in Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2 are described in the following sections. Section 6.4 presents the sources and methods for estimating emissions. Section 6.5 explains the relationship between emissions and ambient pollution. Section 6.6 introduces the quantification of the health burden of air pollution and Section 6.7 presents the quantification of the economic impacts of pollution. This Chapter presents additional sections to validate findings (Section 6.8) and make the user aware of the limits (Section 6.9) of the air pollution module."

The GAINS scenario selected as baseline is the ECLIPSE_V5a_CLE_base. This dataset was created in June 2015 and it covers emissions from 1990 to 2050 in five-year intervals. This baseline scenario considers current legislation (CLE) and committed legislation. The emission factors were grouped to reflect CPAT sectors and fuels, as described in Wagner et al. (2020).\nThe basic principle to estimate emissions in GAINS is presented in expression (Equation 6.1). Emissions are driven by activity levels (such as energy consumption), emissions factors that depend on the process and fuel type utilized (if any) and technology implementations that account for possible pollution control technologies (such as particulate filters, electrostatic precipitators, among many others). The emission factors used in CPAT include country specific technology implementations, according to the Current Legislation Scenario.\n\\[Emissions = FuelConsumption*Emission\\ Factors \\tag{6.1}\\]\nIn CPAT, the pollutants included are PM2.5, NOx, SO2, CO2, NMVOC, BC, OC, CH4, CO, while the sectors and fuels for which we have emissions factors are presented in Table 6.1 4.\n\n\nTable 6.1: Emission factor sectors and fuels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSector\nSubsector\nBiomass\nCoal\nDiesel\nGasoline\nJet fuel\nKerosene\nLPG\nNatural Gas\nOther oil products\n\n\n\n\nPower\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\nX\nX\n\n\nResidential\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\nTransport\nRoad transport\n\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\nAviation\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRail\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustries\nConstruction\n\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\nFood and Forestry\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\nMining & Chemicals\n\n\nX\nX\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\nOther Manufacturing\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\nServices\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\nSource: Own elaboration based on Wagner et al.

However, the reduction of local pollutants can imply an increase in global warming, because of the cooling effect of some of these pollutants. Some local pollutants behave asymmetrically compared to GHGs: the more they are emitted, the more they cool the earth. Figure 6.6 presents a diagram of the cooling and warming effects of reducing pollutants.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Diagram of the impact of pollution control on emissions and climate impact\n\n\nSource: Shindell (2013)5.

FASST is a source-receptor model with linearized relations between emissions and concentrations. This tool allows the modeling of ambient PM2.5 and O3 concentrations.\nFASST includes 56 source-receptor regions (see Figure 6.8) and the pollutants considered (as emissions) are SO2, NOx, NH3, OC, NMVOC, Elemental Carbon, Primary Organic Matter6, PM2.57 and CH4.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: The 56 continental emission source regions in TM5-FASST\n\n\nSource: Van Dingenen et al. (2018)\n\n\n\nThe coefficients from the source-receptor matrices are given by Equation 6.2 and the concentration in receptor \\(y\\) from component \\(j\\) are presented in Equation 6.3 - see Van Dingenen et al. (2018).\n\\[A_{\\text{ij}}\\left\\lbrack x,\\ y \\right\\rbrack = \\frac{\\mathrm{\\Delta}C_{j}(y)}{\\mathrm{\\Delta}E_{i}\\left( x \\right)} \\tag{6.2}\\]\nWith \\(\\mathrm{\\Delta}E_{i}\\left( x \\right) = 0.2E_{i,base}\\left( x \\right)\\)\nWhere:\n\\(A_{\\text{ij}}\\): source-receptor matrix coefficient (annual mean responses) in \\(\\mu\\)g/m3\n\\(x\\): source region\n\\(y\\): receptor point\n\\(j\\): component (PM2.5 and O3)\n\\(i\\): precursor of j (BC, POM, SO2, NOx and OPM for j = PM2.5; and NOx, NMVOC, SO2 and CH4 for j= O3)\nAmbient concentration in receptor \\(y\\) from component \\(j\\) is calculated using expression (Equation 6.3).\n\\[C_{j}\\left( y \\right) = C_{j,\\ base}\\left( y \\right) + \\sum_{k = 1}^{n_{x}}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{i}}{A_{\\text{ij}}\\left\\lbrack x_{k},\\ y \\right\\rbrack*\\left\\lbrack E_{i}\\left( x_{k} \\right) - E_{i,\\ base}\\left( x_{k} \\right) \\right\\rbrack*UrbanIncFactor}} \\tag{6.3}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(A_{\\text{ij}}\\): source-receptor matrix coefficient (annual mean responses)\n\\(n_{i}\\): number of precursors \\(i\\)\n\\(n_{x}\\): number of source regions \\(x\\)\n\\(E_{i}(x)\\): emission rate (kg/yr) of precursor I at source x\n\\(C_{j,\\ base}\\left( y \\right)\\): constant for pollutant \\(j\\) and location \\(y\\)\n\\(k\\): pollutant\nThe precursors for PM2.5 included are BC, POM, SO2, NOx and OPM (other particulate matter). Notice that NH3 emissions are not included in the analysis and are assumed to be constant over time.\nThe precursors of ozone considered are NOx, NMVOC, SO2 and CH4.\nAs mentioned, FASST contains results for 56 regions only. To produce source-receptor coefficients for every country inside those regions, we applied a down-scaling of FASST to produce country level coefficients. The methods are described in Aleluia Reis (2020).\nIn addition to the country down-scaling from Aleluia Reis (2020), we produced a downscale based in the population in the FASST regions and in the countries inside those regions, as presented in expression Equation 6.4. In some cases, we applied the population downscale, when the performance of the method described in Aleluia Reis (2020) is low.\n\\[A_{i,j,country} = A_{i,j,region}*\\frac{\\text{Population}_{\\text{region}}}{\\text{Population}_{\\text{country}}} \\tag{6.4}\\]\nIf we multiply the emissions \\(j\\) from the modeled sectors by the corresponding \\(A_{i,j}\\) coefficients, we obtain the `modeled’ contribution to \\(i\\)(where \\(i\\) is PM2.5 or O3) in CPAT, using expression Equation 6.5.\n\\[\\text{Modeled\\ }i_{t,s} = \\sum_{j}^{}{\\sum_{s}^{}{A_{i,j}*Emissions_{j,s,t}}} \\tag{6.5}\\]\n\n6.5.2.1 From FASST spreadsheet to CPAT\nIn the spreadsheet version of FASST (provided by Rita Van Dingenen), there are two emission scenarios and each of them is compared to FASST baseline scenario (there are three scenarios in total). In CPAT, we do not use the FASST baseline scenario, but only two scenarios: baseline (as in CPAT) and carbon price (as in CPAT). We do not need to include the FASST baseline scenario in CPAT because to quantify the changes in PM2.5 (or in O3), attributed to the carbon tax, we subtract the results from the baseline and the carbon tax. In that operation, FASST baseline would be eliminated anyways and because of that is not needed.\nTable 6.7 presents the operations in FASST spreadsheet and CPAT adaptations. In the last column of the table, I mention the ‘transformations’ to the SR coefficients used in CPAT, so the operations are simplified. These transformations yield the same changes in PM2.5 that we would obtain using the original steps performed in the spreadsheet of FASST, because all operations are linear.\n\n\nTable 6.7: CPAT adaptations of TM5-FASST, spreadsheet version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmissions\nFASST spreadsheet calculation (USER_CALC_1)\nCPAT adaptations\n\n\n\n\nUses BC emissions\n\\(\\text{delta}_{BC - &gt; BC,1} = \\left( Em_{BC,1} - EmFASST_{\\text{BC}} \\right)*SR_{BC - &gt; BC}\\)\nIn CPAT I multiply BC emissions by \\(SR_{BC - &gt; BC}*urbanIncfactor = \\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{BC,\\ CPAT}}\\)\n\n\nUses POM emissions= 1.3*OC\n\\(\\text{delta}_{POM - &gt; POM} = \\left( Em_{POM,1} - EmFASST_{\\text{POM}} \\right)*SR_{POM - &gt; POM}\\)\nIn CPAT I multiply POM emissions by \\(SR_{POM - &gt; POM}*urbanIncfactor = \\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{POM,\\ CPAT}}\\)\n\n\nUses Other PM emissions = PM2.5-BC-POM\n\\(\\text{delta}_{OPrPM2.5 - &gt; OPrPM2.5,1} = \\left( Em_{OPrPM2.5,1} - EmFASST_{OPrPM2.5} \\right)*SR_{\\mathbf{BC - &gt; BC}}\\)\nIn CPAT I multiply Other PM2.5 emissions by \\(SR_{BC - &gt; BC}*urbanIncfactor = \\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{BC,\\ CPAT}}\\)\n\n\nUses SO2 emissions\n\\(\\text{delta}_{SO2 - &gt; SO4,1} = \\left( Em_{SO2,1} - EmFASST_{SO2} \\right)*SR_{SO2 - &gt; SO4}\\)\nIn CPAT, I multiply the emissions of SO2 by \\(SR_{SO2 - &gt; SO4} + \\ SR_{SO2 - &gt; NO3} + \\ SR_{SO2 - &gt; NH4} = \\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{SO2,\\ CPAT}}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{delta}_{SO2 - &gt; NO3,1} = \\left( Em_{SO2,1} - EmFASST_{SO2} \\right)*SR_{SO2 - &gt; NO3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{delta}_{SO2 - &gt; NH4,1} = \\left( Em_{SO2,1} - EmFASST_{SO2} \\right)*SR_{SO2 - &gt; NH4}\\)\n\n\n\nUses NOx emissions\n\\(\\text{delta}_{NOx - &gt; SO4,1} = \\left( Em_{NOx,1} - EmFASST_{\\text{NOx}} \\right)*SR_{NOx - &gt; SO4}\\)\nIn CPAT, I multiply the emissions of NOx by \\(SR_{NOx - &gt; SO4} + \\ SR_{NOx - &gt; NO3} + \\ SR_{NOx - &gt; NH4} = \\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{NOx,\\ CPAT}}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{delta}_{NOx - &gt; NO3,1} = \\left( Em_{NOx,1} - EmFASST_{\\text{NOx}} \\right)*SR_{NOx - &gt; NO3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{delta}_{NOx - &gt; NH4,1} = \\left( Em_{NOx,1} - EmFASST_{\\text{NOx}} \\right)*SR_{NOx - &gt; NH4}\\)\n\n\n\nUses NH3 emissions\n\\(\\text{delta}_{NH3 - SO4,1} = \\left( Em_{NH3,1} - EmFASST_{NH3} \\right)*SR_{NH3 - SO4}\\)\nIn CPAT, we do not have NH3 emissions\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{delta}_{NH3 - &gt; NO3,1} = \\left( Em_{NH3,1} - EmFASST_{NH3} \\right)*SR_{NH3 - &gt; NO3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{delta}_{NH3 - &gt; NH4,1} = \\left( Em_{NH3,1} - EmFASST_{NH3} \\right)*SR_{NH3 - &gt; NH4}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \\(\\text{EmFASST}\\) are FASST base emissions and \\(Em_{p,1}\\) are emissions from pollutant \\(p\\) in scenario 1.\nIn the tab USER_CALC_1, \\(\\text{delta}_{\\text{BC}}\\) and \\(\\text{delta}_{\\text{POM}}\\) are then multiplied by the urban incremental factor.\n\\[d_{BC,1} = delta_{BC,1}*urbIncfactor \\tag{6.6}\\]\n\\[d_{POM,2} = delta_{POM,1}*urbIncfactor \\tag{6.7}\\]\nAnd the following aggregations among deltas are made:\n\\[d_{SO4,1} = delta_{SO2 \\rightarrow SO4,1} + delta_{NOx - &gt; SO4,1} + delta_{NH3 - SO4,1} \\tag{6.8}\\] \\[d_{NO3,1} = delta_{SO2 - &gt; NO3,1} + delta_{NOX - &gt; NO3,1} + delta_{NH3 - &gt; NO3,1} \\tag{6.9}\\]\n\\[d_{NH4,1} = delta_{SO2 - &gt; NH4,1} + delta_{NOx - &gt; NH4,1} + delta_{NH3 - &gt; NH4,1} \\tag{6.10}\\]\n\\[d_{OPrPM2.5,1} = delta_{OPrPM2.5 - &gt; OPrPM2.5,1} \\tag{6.11}\\]\nFinally, the total change in PM2.5 concentrations in scenario 1 is:\n\\[\\text{TOTdP}M_{1} = d_{BC,\\ 1} + d_{POM,\\ 1\\ } + d_{SO4,1} + d_{NO3,1} + d_{NH4,1} + d_{OPrPM2.5,1} \\tag{6.12}\\]\nWhere \\(\\text{TOTdP}M_{1}\\) is the change in concentration with respect to FASST Baseline.\nThe same procedure is applied to calculate \\(\\text{TOTdP}M_{2}\\), using the emissions of the scenario 2. \\(\\text{TOTdP}M_{2}\\ \\) is the change in PM2.5 form scenario 2 versus FASST baseline scenario.\nThen, in tab RESULTS, the change in PM2.5 among scenario 2 and scenario 1 is equal to \\(\\text{TOTdP}M_{2} - TOTdP1.\\ \\) Because all equations are linear, we do not need to use FASST baseline emissions when we want to calculate changes in PM2.5 from two scenarios in CPAT.\n\n\n\n6.5.3 Option 2: Source apportionment information\nAn alternative to the previous approach is to use source apportionment information, either from the WHO Source Apportionment (World Health Organization (2015)) database or from another source. The user might have access to local studies regarding the contribution to ambient PM2.5 from different emission sources and that information could be manually entered into CPAT.\nThe WHO database contains source apportionment information for 317 locations in 46 countries. Figure 6.9 presents the average contributions by sector in the regions of the world covered by the database.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Average source apportionment for PM2.5, selected regions of the world\n\n\nSource: WHO database on local source apportionment studies\nCPAT can combine the information from source apportionment studies with the source apportionment result from applying the TM5-FASST coefficients. For each sector, we estimate an adjustment factor, \\(\\text{AF}_{s},\\) to TM5-FASST coefficients, such that the external source contribution by sector will be met in the baseline year \\(\\text{to}\\). The adjustment factor for each sector \\(s\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\\text{AF}_{s} = \\frac{\\text{ShareFASST}_{s,to}}{\\text{ShareExterna}l_{s}} \\tag{6.13}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(\\text{AF}_{s}\\): Adjustment factor for sector \\(s\\) (\\(s\\)= coal power plants, gas power plants, other power plants, ground level road, residential-construction-services, agriculture, other sectors).\n\\(\\text{ShareFASS}T_{s}\\): % Contribution to ambient PM2.5 from sector \\(s\\), calculated using FASST coefficients\n\\(\\text{ShareExterna}l_{s}\\): % Contribution to ambient PM2.5 from sector \\(s\\), according to user’s input or to WHO database.\nThe modeled ambient PM2.5 under this option in CPAT is calculated as follows.\n\\[\\text{Modeled~PM}{2.5}_{t} = \\sum_{p}^{}{\\sum_{s}^{}{AF_{s}*\\text{FASST}_{p,s}*Emissions_{p,s,t}}} \\tag{6.14}\\]\nIn CPAT, we have uploaded the source apportionment information for the 46 countries included in the WHO database, as well as additional studies covering additional countries (see Table 6.9 for the country coverage of each study). The correspondence between the sectors in the WHO database and CPAT air pollution sectors is presented in Table 6.8.\n\n\nTable 6.8: Matching from WHO database sectors and CPAT air pollution tab sectors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO database sectors\nCPAT AP sectors\n\n\n\n\nIndustry\nCoal Power Plants\n\n\nIndustry\nGas Power Plants\n\n\nIndustry\nOther Power Plants\n\n\nTrafﬁc\nRoad transport\n\n\nIndustry / Domestic fuel burning\nResidential, services and construction\n\n\nIndustry\nIndustries and other energy\n\n\nUnspeciﬁed source of human origin\nFood & forestry (includes agriculture)\n\n\nNatural sources (dust and sea salt)\nUnknown (not modeled, natural, outside borders)\n\n\n\n\nSource: Own elaboration. The WHO sector “Unspecified source of human origin” includes secondary formation of PM2.5 and it’s distributed among all CPAT sectors, including the “unknown” category in the proportions of each sector calculated using FASST coefficients.\nCPAT allows the user to input other source apportionment distribution (manual input) and also includes a default distribution for most countries, based in the WHO database. The default source apportionment distribution is equal to the regional average, that can be used if the country is not covered in the WHO database. The information source used is indicated in the Air pollution module, under the section “Calibration options from the Dashboard/MSTInputs tab”.\nTable 6.9 presents the country coverage of each of the studies preloaded in CPAT.\n\n\nTable 6.9: Countries covered by source apportionment studies in CPAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nCountries covered\n\n\n\n\nWorld Health Organization (2015)\nArgentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Macedonia, FYR, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Vietnam\n\n\nWorld Bank (2020)\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\nAlmeida et al.

The ambient concentrations predicted represent population weighted averages per country. At the moment CPAT offers the elastic net model option only for PM2.5.\nThe results of the elastic net model are combined with an OLS model. The results of the OLS model are used only to distribute the contribution of modeled PM2.5 among CPAT sectors, while the elastic net model is used to predict total ambient concentrations of PM2.5.\nThe following table summarizes the data sources used to develop the elastic net and OLS models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nData source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmissions\n\n\nCAMS Global Anthropogenic v4.2, 2000-2020, monthly, 0.1°\n\n\n\n\nConcentrations\n\n\nCAMS Global Reanalysis (EAC4) monthly averaged fields (Inness et al.

In the next subsections we describe the implementation of the elastic net and OLS models in CPAT.\n\n6.5.4.1 Elastic net model\nAs mentioned above, the elastic net model is used to predict total ambient PM2.5 in CPAT. The functional form and the adaptations made to the original coefficients of the model is detailed in the following paragraphs.\nMonthly concentrations of PM2.5\nThe linear regressions developed to predict monthly levels of PM2.5 takes the form indicated in expression Equation 6.15 for each country.\n\\[P{M2.5}_{m} = \\alpha + \\sum_{s,p}^{}{\\beta_{s,p}*E_{s,p,m}} + \\gamma_{1}*PPT_{m} + \\gamma_{2}*TMIN_{m} + \\gamma_{3}*TMAX_{m} + \\gamma_{4}*\\text{VPD}_{m} + \\gamma_{5}*\\text{WS}_{m} + \\gamma_{6}*\\text{WD}_{m} + \\sum_{s}^{}{{\\delta_{s}*T}_{s,m} + \\sum_{p}^{}{\\lambda_{p}*T_{p,m}}} + \\mu*T_{nox,m}*T_{NH3,m} + \\nu*T_{SO2,m}*T_{NH3,m} + \\xi*T_{SO2,m}*T_{NOx,m} + {\\sum_{s}^{}{{\\theta_{s}*T_{s,m}*WS}_{m}*WD_{m}} + \\phi}_{m} + \\varepsilon_{m} \\tag{6.15}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(m\\) = Months of the year, from 1 to 12\n\\(s\\  \\in \\{ agr,\\ roa,\\ pow,\\ inx,\\ otr,\\ oth,\\ ser\\}\\)\n\\(p\\  \\in \\left\\{ BC,\\ OC,\\ NH_{3},\\ NO_{x},\\ NMVOC,\\ SO_{2} \\right\\}\\)\n\\(P{M2.5}_{m}\\) = Concentration of PM2.5 in month \\(m\\), in \\(\\mu g/m^{3}\\)\n\\({O3}_{m}\\) = Concentration of \\(O_{3}\\) in month \\(m\\), in \\(6mDMA8h\\)8\n\\(E_{s,p,m}\\) = Emissions of sector \\(s\\) and pollutant \\(p\\) in month \\(m\\), in \\(Tg\\)\n\\(\\text{PP}T_{m}\\) = Accumulated precipitation in mm, month \\(m\\)\n\\(\\text{TMI}N_{m}\\) = Minimum temperature in \\(\\deg{C}\\) month \\(m\\)\n\\(\\text{VP}D_{m}\\) = Mean vapor pressure deficit in kPa, month \\(m\\)\n\\(WS_{m}\\) = wind speed in \\(\\frac{m}{s}\\), month \\(m\\)\n\\(WD_{m}\\) = Wind direction in degrees, month \\(m\\)\n\\(T_{p,m}\\) = composite index from the sum of total emissions of pollutant \\(p\\), in month \\(m\\)\n\\(T_{s,m}\\) = composite index from the sum of total emissions of sector \\(s\\), in month \\(m\\)\n\\(\\phi_{m}\\) = Monthly fixed effects\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) = Error term\nAnnual concentrations of PM2.5\nIn CPAT, we work on an annual basis, while the elastic net model was developed to predict PM2.5 in a monthly basis. Thus, we adapt the elastic net model results to predict annual concentration of PM2.5, as explain below.\nEach month of the year will have a weight according to its number of days, equal to \\(\\varphi_{m}\\). For instance, for February, it’s weight in the annual average is \\(\\varphi_{2} = 28/365\\).\nThe weighted average PM2.5 will be calculated according to expression .\n\\[PM2.5 = \\sum_{m}^{}{\\varphi_{m}*PM{2.5}_{m}} \\tag{6.16}\\]\nWhich can be written as expression Equation 6.17.\n\\[PM2.5 = \\alpha + \\sum_{s,p}^{}{\\beta_{s,p}*\\overline{E_{s,p}}} + \\gamma_{1}*\\overline{\\text{PPT}} + \\gamma_{2}*\\overline{\\text{TMIN}} + \\gamma_{3}*\\overline{\\text{TMAX}} + \\gamma_{4}*\\overline{\\text{VPD}} + \\gamma_{5}*\\overline{\\text{WS}} +

emissions of sector \\(s\\) in month \\(m\\), \\(T_{s,m}\\), such that \\(sum_{m = 1}^{12}{w_{s,m} = 1}\\).\nAnnual concentration of PM2.5 in CPAT\nIn CPAT, we group and consider constant all the weather variables, together with the intercept of the model and monthly fixed effects.\nFor each country, we define a weather constant equal to:\n\\[{Weather = \\gamma}_{1}*\\overline{\\text{PPT}} + \\gamma_{2}*\\overline{\\text{TMIN}} + \\gamma_{3}*\\overline{\\text{TMAX}} + \\gamma_{4}*\\overline{\\text{VPD}} + \\gamma_{5}*\\overline{\\text{WS}} + \\gamma_{6}*\\overline{\\text{WD}} \\tag{6.18}\\]\nWhere \\(\\overline{\\text{VAR}} = \\sum_{m}^{}{\\varphi_{m}*\\text{VAR}_{m}}\\)\nWe define new constants, according to expressions Equation 6.19 to Equation 6.26.\n\\[\\delta_{s}^{'} = \\delta_{s}*\\sum_{m}^{}{\\varphi_{m}*w_{s,m}} \\tag{6.19}\\] \\[\\lambda_{p}^{'} = \\lambda_{p}*\\sum_{m}^{}{\\varphi_{m}*w_{p,m}} \\tag{6.20}\\] \\[\\mu' = \\mu*\\sum_{m}^{}{\\varphi_{m}*w_{NOx,m}*w_{NH3,m}} \\tag{6.21}\\] \\[\\nu' = \\nu*\\sum_{m}^{}{\\varphi_{m}*w_{SO2,m}*w_{NH3,m}} \\tag{6.22}\\] \\[\\xi' =

\\beta_{s,p}/12 \\tag{6.25}\\] \\[{\\beta''}_{s,p} = {(\\beta'}_{s,p}{+ \\lambda'}_{p}) \\tag{6.26}\\]\nAnd we estimate annual PM2.5 using expression Equation 6.27.\n\\[PM2.5 = \\alpha + Weather + \\overline{\\phi} + \\sum_{s,p}^{}{\\beta_{s,p}*\\overline{E_{s,p}}} + \\sum_{s}^{}{{{\\delta'}_{s}*T}_{s} + \\sum_{p}^{}{{\\lambda'}_{p}*T_{p}}} + \\mu'*T_{\\text{NOx}}*T_{NH3} + \\nu'*T_{SO2}*T_{NH3} + \\xi'*T_{SO2}*T_{\\text{NOx}} + \\sum_{s}^{}{{\\theta'}_{s}*T_{s}} + \\varepsilon_{m} \\tag{6.27}\\]\nThe contribution of each sector to PM2.5 will be calculated according to expression Equation 6.28.\n\\[\\text{PM}{2.5}_{s} = \\sum_{p}^{}{{\\beta'}_{s,p}*T_{p,s}} + {{\\delta'}_{s}*T}_{s} + \\sum_{p}^{}{{\\lambda'}_{p}*T_{p,s}} + \\mu'*T_{NOx,s}*T_{NH3,s} + \\nu'*T_{SO2,s}*T_{NH3,s} + \\xi'*T_{SO2,s}*T_{NOx,s} + {\\theta'}_{s}*T_{s} \\tag{6.28}\\]\nGrouping terms, we can write the contribution to PM2.5 by sector as indicated in expression Equation 6.29.\n\\[\\text{PM}{2.5}_{s} = \\sum_{p}^{}{{(\\beta'}_{s,p}{+ \\lambda'}_{p})*T_{p,s}} + {({\\delta^{'}}_{s} + {\\theta^{'}}_{s})*T}_{s} + \\mu'*T_{NOx,s}*T_{NH3,s} + \\nu'*T_{SO2,s}*T_{NH3,s} + \\xi'*T_{SO2,s}*T_{NOx,s} \\tag{6.29}\\]\nLet’s call \\({\\beta''}_{s,p} = {(\\beta'}_{s,p}{+ \\lambda'}_{p})\\) and \\({\\delta^{''}}_{s} = ({\\delta^{'}}_{s} + {\\theta^{'}}_{s})\\) and write \\(\\text{PM}{2.5}_{s}\\) as in expression Equation 6.30.\n\\[\\text{PM}{2.5}_{s} = \\sum_{p}^{}{{\\beta''}_{s,p}*T_{p,s}} + {{\\delta''}_{s}*T}_{s} + \\mu'*T_{NOx,s}*T_{NH3,s} + \\nu'*T_{SO2,s}*T_{NH3,s} + \\xi'*T_{SO2,s}*T_{NOx,s} \\tag{6.30}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(T_{p,s}\\) = composite index from the sum of total emissions of pollutant \\(p\\) in sector \\(s\\), including all the months of the year\nThe term \\(\\alpha + Weather + \\overline{\\phi} + \\varepsilon_{m}\\) is not sector specific and it is considered a constant in CPAT.\nThe term Equation 6.31 is also non-sector specific and is relating the interactions across emissions of the different sectors.\n\\[\\mu'*(T_{\\text{NOx}}*T_{NH3} - \\sum_{s}^{}{T_{NOx,s}*T_{NH3,s}}) + \\nu'*{(T}_{SO2}*T_{NH3} - \\sum_{s}^{}{T_{SO2,s}*T_{NH3,s}}) + \\xi'*(T_{SO2}*T_{\\text{NOx}} - \\sum_{s}^{}{T_{SO2,s}*T_{NOx,s}}) \\tag{6.31}\\]\n\n\n6.5.4.2 OLS model\nAs mentioned before, in CPAT we apply the results of an OLS model to quantify the percent contribution of each sector to ambient PM2.5, while we use the elastic net model to predict total concentrations.\nThe OLS model has the functional form in expression Equation 6.32.\n\\[P{M2.5}_{m} = \\alpha + \\sum_{s}^{}{\\delta_{s}*\\widehat{T_{s,m}}} + \\gamma_{1}*PPT_{m} + \\gamma_{2}*TMIN_{m} + \\gamma_{3}*TMAX_{m} + \\gamma_{4}*\\text{VPD}_{m} + \\gamma_{5}*\\text{WS}_{m} + \\gamma_{6}*\\text{WD}_{m} + \\varepsilon_{m} \\tag{6.32}\\]\nWhere \\(\\widehat{T_{s,m}}\\) is a composite index of total normalized emissions in month \\(m\\) and sector \\(s\\). The procedure to normalize emissions is explained below.\nNormalization of emissions for OLS model\nFor each country, let’s call normalized emissions by sector and pollutant and month, \\(\\widehat{E_{s,p,m}}\\), that is calculated using expression Equation 6.33.\n\\[\\widehat{E_{s,p,m}} = \\frac{E_{s,p,m} - \\text{Min}_{s,p}}{\\text{Max}_{s,p} - \\text{Min}_{s,p}} \\tag{6.33}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(E_{s,p,m}\\): emissions in month \\(m\\) per pollutant \\(p\\) and sector \\(s\\)\n\\(\\text{Min}_{s,p}\\): Min emission across months for pollutant \\(p\\) and sector \\(s\\)\n\\(\\text{Max}_{s,p}\\): Max emission across months for pollutant \\(p\\) and sector \\(s\\)\nThen, the index \\(\\widehat{T_{s,m}}\\) is calculated using expression Equation 6.34.\n\\[\\widehat{T_{s,m}} = \\sum_{p}^{}\\widehat{E_{s,p,m}} \\tag{6.34}\\]\nIn CPAT, we do not calculate monthly emissions, but annual emissions, thus, the normalization of emissions and the index of total normalized emissions by sector considers annual emissions by sector and pollutant.\n\n\n\n6.5.5 Option 4: Intake fractions\nAnother option in CPAT to relate emissions to ambient concentration of PM2.5 is using intake fractions. Intake fractions were defined in Bennett et al. (2002) as the integrated incremental intake of a pollutant, summed over all exposed individuals, and occurring over a given exposure time, released from a specified source or source class, per unit of pollutant emitted. Intake fractions measure the change in population-weighted ambient concentrations of a pollutant (PM2.5 in this case) per unit of pollutant emitted Cropper et al. (2012). Zhou et al. (2006) defined intake fractions as the fraction of material or its precursors released from a source that is eventually inhaled or ingested by a population. Intake fractions are defined by Equation 6.35.\n\\[iF = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{P_{i}*\\mathrm{\\Delta}C_{i}*BR}}{Q} \\tag{6.35}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(\\text{iF}\\): Intake Fraction, inhaled grams of PM2.5 per ton (ppm) of emissions\n\\(P_{i}\\): population residing in a region located at a distance \\(i\\) from the emission source\n\\(\\text{ΔC}_{i}\\): change in ambient concentration of PM2.5 g/m3\n\\(\\text{BR}\\): Average breathing rate in cubic meters per day m3/day\n\\(Q\\): Emissions rate tonne/day\nFrom Equation 6.35, rearranging the terms, we can express changes in concentration weighted average as shown in Equation 6.36.\n\\[\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{P_{i}*\\mathrm{\\Delta}C_{i}} = \\frac{iF*Q}{\\text{BR}} \\tag{6.36}\\]\nIntake fractions are influenced by the emissions height, as illustrated in Figure 6.10. Ground level emissions are usually inhaled in a major proportion, compared with emissions from a high stack.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Illustration of Intake fraction variation according to emissions height\n\n\nSource: Parvez, Lamancusa, and Wagstrom (2017)\nAt the same time, intake fractions depend on the population density at different distances from the emission source. As illustrated in Figure 6.11, higher population concentrations will increase the intake fraction value, since more people is inhaling pollution.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: Illustration of intake fractions variation according to distance from the source and population concentration.\n\n\nSource: Lamancusa, Parvez, and Wagstrom (2017)\n\n6.5.5.1 Intake fractions for ground level, low and high stack emission sources\nIn CPAT, for sources different than power plants, we use the results from Apte et al. (2012). The study estimates intake fractions for more than 3,600 cities, for ground level sources and for direct emissions of PM2.5.\nIn the case of secondary pollutants, we will scale up the ground-level secondary intake fractions from Humbert et al. (2011), presented in Table 6.10, using the ratio between primary PM2.5 intake fractions from Apte et al. (2012) and Humbert et al. (2011), as indicated in Equation 6.37.\n\\[\\text{iF}_{\\text{secondary\\ pollutant}} = \\frac{\\text{iF}_{PM2.5,\\ Apte}}{\\text{iF}_{PM2.5,\\ Humbert}}*\\text{iF}_{\\text{secondary\\ Humbert}}\\  \\tag{6.37}\\]\n\n\nTable 6.10: Intake fractions (ppm) for ground level PM2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPollutants\n\nUrban\nRural\nRemote\n\n\n\n\nPrimary PM2.5\nGround-level PM2.5\n44\n3.8\n0.1\n\n\n\nhigh-stack\n11\n1.6\n0.1\n\n\n\nlow-stack\n15\n2.0\n0.1\n\n\nSecondary PM2.5\nSO2\n0.99\n0.79\n0.05\n\n\n\nNOx\n0.2\n0.17\n0.01\n\n\n\nNH3\n1.7\n1.7\n0.1\n\n\n\n\nSource: Humbert et al.

In order to include the geographically extended effect of power plants emissions into the analysis, we will use intake fractions that were developed specifically for this sector, following Zhou et al. (2006).\nZhou et al. (2006) estimates intake fractions for 29 power plants in China and proposes a methodology to calculate intake fractions in other regions of the world using population and precipitation data. The authors extrapolated the intake fraction results to other sites using regression analysis (see Table 6.11). This methodology (Zhou et al. (2006)) was applied by on the spreadsheet model developed by Parry et al. (2014) and subsequent IMF iterations.\nCPAT intake fractions use updated data regarding power plant’s location and population distribution around them, together with differentiating exposed population inside country borders and outside countries. The methodology is illustrated in Figure 6.12.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: Methodology for estimating intake fractions for power plants\n\n\nSource: Own elaboration\nThe following table provides a comparison between the approach implemented by Parry et al.

(2018)). The database contains 2,390 coal plants, 3,922 gas power plants and 2,290 oil power plants.\nThe team decided to use this database, since CARMA database has not been updated since 2012 (Byers et al. (2018)). Figure 6.13 shows, as an example, the location of the coal power plants included in the database.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.13: Location of Coal Power Plants\n\n\nSource: Based on Global Energy Observatory, Google, KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Enipedia, World Resources Institute (2018) 11\nZhou et al. (2006) requires estimating population around different distances of each power plant. To estimate population inside different distance buffers, gridded population data was obtained from the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), from Columbia university. The population-count raster file used consists of estimates of human population (number of persons per pixel), consistent with national censuses and population registers, for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 (CPAT analysis is based on 2020). The data set consists of global raster files at 30 arc-second horizontal resolution (approximately 1 km at the equator). The 30 arc-second12 data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions (Center for International Earth Science Information Network - CIESIN - Columbia University (2018)). The team decided to use this dataset, instead of Landscan 2017, since the former is available free of charge, and both sources provide equivalent quality and resolution.\nThe methodology in Zhou et al. (2006) allows the inclusion of the variable precipitations. Precipitations data13 was obtained from The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) Climate and Land Cover, v1 (1901 – 2000)14 (Reid and Raudsepp-Hearne (2005)). This dataset contains raster grids for monthly average precipitations.\nFor each power plant, we built a distance buffer of 40 kilometers and we compute the average precipitation inside that buffer. That variable is then used to predict intake fractions for each power plant, according to in Zhou et al. (2006).\nThe regression coefficients from Zhou et al. (2006), presented in Table 6.11, will be used to estimate an intake fraction for each power plant in each country.\n\n\nTable 6.11: Coefficients for intake fractions from Zhou et al.

(2006).\nNotes: Estimate significant at 0.05 level. Estimate significant at 0.10 level. Population variables in millions; precipitation in mm/yr\nThe intake fraction for each power plant is calculated according to Equation 6.39, using the coefficients from Table 6.11.\n\\[{iF}_{p,\\ j,\\ l} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{4}{\\beta_{i,j}*{P\\text{op}}_{i,\\ l} + \\beta_{5,\\ j}*{P\\text{recipitation}}_{p}} \\tag{6.39}\\]\nWhere:\n\\({iF}_{p,\\ j,\\ c}\\): Intake fraction for power plant \\(p\\), pollutant \\(j\\), location \\(l\\)\n\\({P\\text{op}}_{i,\\ l}\\): Population at distance \\(i\\), location \\(l\\)\n\\({P\\text{recipitation}}_{p}\\): Precipitations around plant \\(p\\)\n\\(\\beta_{i,j}\\): Regression coefficients for pollutant \\(j\\), location \\(l\\)\n\\[i = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\n\\ \\ \\ \\ 1,\\ \\ Population\\ within\\ 100\\ km\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \\\\\n2,\\ \\ Population\\ between\\ 100\\ and\\ 500\\ km\\ \\ \\  \\\\\n3,\\ \\ Population\\ between\\ 500\\ and\\ 1000\\ km \\\\\n4,\\ \\ Population\\ within\\ 1000\\ and\\ 2000\\ km\\  \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\]\n\\(j\\)= SO2, PM1, PM3, PM7, PM13, SO4, NO3\n\\(l\\) = inside country, outside country\nThen, country level averages will be computed as the weighted average of the \\(\\text{iF}\\) of each plant located inside the country, using as the weight the power generation15 of each power plant.\nFinally, we calculate the changes in PM2.5 concentrations rearranging the terms in Equation 6.35, assuming that the entire population is exposed to the weighted average concentration. We also adjust the units to obtain changes in concentration in µg/m3. \\(\\text{CM}\\) corresponds to the implied “concentration matrix” that relates changes in concentration derived from 1 ton of emissions per year.\n\\[CM = \\frac{\\Delta C\\lbrack\\frac{\\text{μg}}{m3}\\rbrack}{1\\ \\lbrack tonne/year\\rbrack} = \\frac{iF\\ (ppm)}{\\text{BR}\\left( \\frac{m3}{d} \\right)*365\\left( \\frac{d}{\\text{year}} \\right)*Pop\\ (capita)}*10^6 \\tag{6.40}\\]\nWhere \\(\\text{ΔC}\\) is the change in ambient concentration of PM2.5, \\(\\text{iF}\\) is a national level average intake fraction, \\(\\text{BR}\\) is an average breathing rate and \\(\\text{Pop}\\) is the country’s population.\n\n\n\n6.5.6 Option 5: Machine learning\nThe user can also choose to use the results of a machine learning approach, developed for CPAT Renna and Reis (2021). The results of the model have been approximated using a discrete function, that relates emissions perturbations to total ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and O3.\n\\(P_{s,p,t}\\) is the perturbation compared to emissions in the baseline year, \\(t_{0}\\), in percentage. We use 2019 as the baseline year and all the perturbations are compared to that year, as presented in Equation 6.41.\n\\[P_{s,p,t} = \\ \\left( \\frac{\\text{Emission}s_{s,p,t}}{\\text{Emissions}_{s,p,t0}} - 1 \\right)*100 \\tag{6.41}\\]\nTotal ambient concentration is a function of \\(P_{s,p,t}\\), composed of a set of linear relationships, according to the level of the perturbation, as presented in Equation 6.42.\n\\[\nC\\ (P_{s,p,t}) =\n\\left\\{\\begin{matrix} \\\\\\\\\n\\text{if } P_{s,p,t} &lt; -100, \\ a_{-100} \\\\\n\\text{if } -100 \\le P_{s,p,t} &lt; -80,\\ \\ \\ a_{- 100} + b_{- 100}*(P_{s,p,t} - ( - 100)) \\\\\n\\text{if } - 80 \\leq P_{s,p,t} &lt; - 60,\\ \\ \\ a_{- 80} + b_{- 80}*(P_{s,p,t} - ( - 80)) \\\\\n\\text{if } - 60 \\leq P_{s,p,t} &lt; - 40,\\ \\ \\ a_{- 60} + b_{- 60}*(P_{s,p,t} - ( - 60)) \\\\\n\\text{if } - 40 \\leq P_{s,p,t} &lt; - 20,\\ \\ \\ a_{- 40} + b_{- 40}*(P_{s,p,t} - \\left( - 40 \\right)) \\\\\n\\text{if } - 20 \\leq P_{s,p,t} &lt; 0,\\ \\ \\ a_{- 20} + b_{- 20}*(P_{s,p,t} - \\left( - 20 \\right)) \\\\\n\\text{if }\\ 0 \\leq P_{s,p,t} &lt; 20,\\ \\ \\ a_{0} + b_{0}*(P_{s,p,t} - 0) \\\\\n\\text{if }\\ 20 \\leq P_{s,p,t} &lt; 40,\\ \\ \\ a_{20} + b_{20}*(P_{s,p,t} - 20) \\\\\n\\text{if }\\ 40 \\leq P_{s,p,t} &lt; 60,\\ \\ \\ a_{40} + b_{40}*(P_{s,p,t} - 40) \\\\\n\\text{if }\\ 60 \\leq P_{s,p,t} &lt; 80,\\ \\ \\ a_{60} + b_{60}*(P_{s,p,t} - 60) \\\\\n\\text{if }\\ 80 \\leq P_{s,p,t} &lt; 100,\\ \\ \\ a_{80} + b_{80}*(P_{s,p,t} - 80) \\\\\n\\text{if }P_{s,p,t} &gt; 100,\\ \\ \\ a_{100} + b_{100}*(P_{s,p,t} - 100) \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\n\\tag{6.42}\\]\nFor the baseline year \\(t_0\\), the contribution of sector \\(s\\) and pollutant \\(p\\) to ambient PM2.5 is presented in Equation 6.43. The mentioned contribution is equivalent to the change in ambient PM2.5 when the emissions are reduced to zero (a -100% perturbation).\n\\[C_{s,p,t_0} = {- C}_{s,p,t}(P_{s,p,t} = - 100) \\tag{6.43}\\]\nThen, the contribution in each year \\(t\\) of sector \\(s\\) and pollutant \\(p\\) to ambient PM2.5 is presented in Equation 6.44.\n\\[C_{s,p,t} = C_{s,p,t}\\left( P_{s,p,t} \\right) - BaselineConcentration + C_{s,p,t_0} \\tag{6.44}\\]\nThe change in contribution to ambient PM2.5 or Ozone is calculated by subtracting the contribution in the baseline and the contribution under the carbon policy scenario.\n\n\n6.5.7 Option 6: Average between two methods\nIn addition to the options to relate emissions and concentrations described above, the user can select the average among two of the methods described: intake fractions (Section 6.5.5) and source-apportionment information combined with TM5-FASST method (Section 6.5.3). We added this option since every method used is subject to uncertainty and using more than one estimate will provide results in the middle range of different model estimates.\n\n\n6.5.8 Modeled and total ambient pollution\nIn CPAT, we estimate emissions from the sectors and fuels presented in Table 6.1 according to the methodology described in Section 6.4. Then, using one of the six options described in Section 6.5, we determine the “modeled” ambient PM2.5 (or O3). The modeled concentration accounts only for fuel burning activities, but not for all ambient pollution.\nOther sources of pollution (not fuel burning) include resuspended dust, sea salt, forest fires, or other transboundary sources that contribute to observed PM2.5. We assume that the sources not modeled in CPAT contribute a \\(C_{0}\\) level to ambient pollution. We calculate the value \\(C_{0}\\) for a baseline year, using Equation 6.45, and we assume it to remain constant across time.\n\\[\\text{Observed}C_{t_0} = Modeled\\ C_{t_0} + C_{0} \\tag{6.45}\\]\nTotal ambient concentration each year \\(t\\) is modeled in CPAT using expression Equation 6.46.\n\\[\\text{Ambient}C_{t} = Modeled\\ C_{t} + C_{0} \\tag{6.46}\\]\nFigure 6.14 presents graphically the methodology applied: a constant \\(C_{0}\\) and a modeled concentration that varies in time.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14: Illustrative example of the projection in time of ambient PM2.5 in CPAT\n\n\nSource: Own elaboration"

RR indicates the likelihood of developing the disease of effect in the exposed group, relative to those who are not exposed.\n\\[\\text{RR} = \\frac{y_{0}}{y_{c}} \\tag{6.47}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(y_{0}\\): the risk (or probability) that people with baseline pollutant exposure will be adversely affected\n\\(y_{c}\\): the risk (or probability) that people with control pollutant exposure will be negatively affected.\nFor example, a RR for all-cause mortality equal to 1.03 per 10 µg/m3 increase in annual PM2.5 means that a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 is associated with a 3% increase in deaths from all causes.\nHazard represents an instantaneous event rate or the probability that an individual would experience an event at a given point in time.\nHazard Ratio is defined as the baseline hazard (\\(H_{0}\\)) divided by hazard in the control group (\\(H_{c}\\)).\n\\[\\text{HR} = \\frac{H_{0}}{H_{c}}\\]\nHazard ratio is often interpreted as relative risk, but they are not technically the same. The main difference is that relative risk does not consider the timing of the event but only the occurrence of the event by the end of the observation period. The hazard ratio considers both.\nIncidence corresponds to the number of new cases of a given disease during a given period in a specified population. It also is used for the rate at which new events occur in a defined population. It is differentiated from prevalence, which refers to all cases, new or old, in the population at a given time18.\n\\[\\text{Incidence}\\ \\text{proportion} = \\ \\frac{\\text{number}\\ \\text{of}\\ \\text{new}\\ \\text{cases}\\ \\text{in}\\ \\text{period}}{\\text{population}\\ \\text{at the start of the}\\ \\text{period}}*10^5\\]\nPrevalence is the total number of cases of a given disease in a specified population at a designated time. It is differentiated from incidence, which refers to the number of new cases in the population at a given time19.\n\\[\\text{Period}\\ \\text{Prevalence} = \\ \\frac{\\text{number}\\ \\text{of}\\ \\text{prevalent}\\ \\text{cases}\\ \\text{in}\\ \\text{period}}{\\text{number}\\ \\text{of}\\ \\text{individuals}\\ \\text{in}\\ \\text{period}}*10^5\\]\nThe population attributable fraction (PAF) is the reduction in incidence that would be observed if the population were entirely unexposed, compared with its current exposure pattern. In other words, PAF is the portion of the incidence that could be reduced if causative exposure were eliminated\n\n\n6.6.3 The health burden of pollution\nThe burden of disease associated with air pollution estimates the reduction in specific causes of death that would occur if the exposure were reduced to an alternative level (in general, the theoretical minimum risk level is used). The methodology combines information regarding population exposure to ambient air pollution and an exposure-response relationship.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.17: Method for burden of disease estimation\n\n\nSource: World Health Organization and others (2018)\nIn CPAT, we implemented a method to assess jointly indoors and outdoors pollution as described in Section 6.6.4.1. CPAT also calculates the impacts of ozone pollution, as described in Section 6.6.4.3.\n\n6.6.3.1 Joint ambient and household air pollution (Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020))\nIn CPAT, we quantify the effects of air pollution following the methodology of the Global Burden of disease study for 2019 (Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020)). The methodology uses and Integrated Exposure Response (IER) approach, basing its estimates in studies for ambient pollution, second-hand smoking and household pollution. This methodology represents and upgrade from the previous version of the study and the main differences with the previous methodology are the following:\n\nGlobal Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020) no longer uses active smoking data in the risk curves. This removes an important source of uncertainty\nNew studies in China and other high-exposure settings are now used20\nNo fixed functional form. Splines generated using MR-BRT (meta-regression boosted regression trees)\n\nThe methodology implemented in CPAT assess jointly the effects of ambient and household pollution. This feature is important because it allows the quantification of a possible increase in the use of solid fuels for cooking (leakage effects) and because household pollution is a major health problem in many countries of the world.\nThe relative risks used in CPAT from Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020) are presented in Figure 6.18. In the case of ischemic heart disease and stroke, the RR presented is an average across all the age groups, which are defined in buckets of 5 years21. In CPAT, we work with the following age groups: neonates, post neonates, under 15, 15 to 64 and 65 years and above. We use the average relative risk withing each group.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.18: RR from the Integrated exposure response function, Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020)\n\n\nNotice that the relative risk takes as a reference the minimum risk level for PM2.5, TMREL, defined as uniform distribution between 2.4 and 5.9 µg/m3. In CPAT, we use as the TMREL the average between 2.4 and 5.9, equal to 4.15 µg/m3 of PM2.5. When pollution is below that level, we would obtain cero health effects attributed to pollution.\nThe diseases and age groups covered by the methodology in CPAT are presented in Table 6.12.\n\n\nTable 6.12: Integrated Exposure Response function diseases from GBD 2019 implemented in CPAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause\nAge Group\nRR\n\n\n\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nAll ages\nConstant across age groups\n\n\nDiabetes mellitus type 2\nAll ages\n\n\n\nLower respiratory infections\nAll ages\n\n\n\nTracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer\nAll ages\n\n\n\nIschemic heart disease\nAbove 25\nChanges with age\n\n\nStroke\nAbove 25\n\n\n\nLow birthweight diseases22,23, excluding lower respiratory infections\nNeonatal (under 28 days)\nConstant\n\n\n\n\nSource: Own elaboration. Note: GBD2019 also quantifies preterm birth24 effects attributed to pollution. We do not quantify this in CPAT, to avoid double counting of effects, when aggregating the total impacts of pollution.\nThe joint methodology requires the fraction of the population that it is exposed to solid fuels for cooking, \\(p_{\\text{HAP}}\\), and the level of exposure to household air pollution (HAP), as the additional exposure over and above ambient exposure to PM2.5 (OAP).\nFor the proportion of the population not exposed to HAP, the relative risk is presented in Equation 6.48.\n\\[\\text{RR}_{\\text{OAP}} = MRBRT(z = \\text{Exp}_{\\text{OAP}})/MRBRT(z = TMREL) \\tag{6.48}\\]\nFor the proportion of the population exposed to HAP, the relative risk is given by Equation 6.49.\n\\[\\text{RR}_{\\text{HAP}} = MRBRT(z = \\text{Exp}_{\\text{OAP}} + \\text{Exp}_{\\text{HAP}})/\\ MRBRT(z = TMREL) \\tag{6.49}\\]\nThe population level relative risk \\(RR_{\\text{PM}}\\) and population attributable fraction, \\(\\text{PA}F_{\\text{PM}}\\), are calculated according to Equation 6.50 and Equation 6.51.\n\\[RR_{\\text{PM}} = RR_{\\text{OAP}}*\\left( 1 - p_{\\text{HAP}} \\right) + RR_{\\text{HAP}}*p_{\\text{HAP}} \\tag{6.50}\\]\n\\[{PAF}_{\\text{PM}} = 1 - 1/RR_{\\text{PM}} \\tag{6.51}\\]\nFinally, PAFs are split based on the exposure to OAP and HAP, as presented in Equation 6.52 and Equation 6.53.\n\\[\\text{PA}F_{\\text{OAP}} = \\frac{\\text{Exp}_{\\text{OAP}}}{\\text{Exp}_{\\text{OAP}} + p_{\\text{HAP}}*\\text{Exp}_{\\text{HAP}}}*\\text{PAF}_{\\text{PM}} \\tag{6.52}\\]\n\\[\\text{PA}F_{\\text{HAP}} = \\frac{{p_{\\text{HAP}}*Exp}_{\\text{HAP}}}{\\text{Exp}_{\\text{OAP}} + {p_{\\text{HAP}}*Exp}_{\\text{HAP}}}*\\text{PAF}_{\\text{PM}} \\tag{6.53}\\]\nNotice that under this strategy \\(\\text{PAF}_{\\text{PM}} = \\text{PAF}_{\\text{HAP}} + \\text{PAF}_{\\text{OAP}}\\).\nWhere:\n\\(\\text{Exp}_{\\text{OAP}}\\): Ambient PM2.5 exposure level\n\\(\\text{Exp}_{\\text{HAP}}\\): Excess exposure to PM2.5 for those who use solid fuel for cooking.\n\\(p_{\\text{HAP}}\\): proportion of the population using solid fuel for cooking\n\\(\\text{RR}_{\\text{OAP}}\\): Relative risk for the proportion of the population not exposed to HAP\n\\(\\text{RR}_{\\text{HAP}}\\): Relative risk for the proportion of the population exposed to HAP\n\\(RR_{\\text{PM}}\\): Population level relative risk\n\\(\\text{PA}F_{\\text{PM}}\\): Population level PAF\nFigure 6.19 presents a diagram of the exposure to PM2.5, \\(\\text{Exp}_{\\text{OAP}}\\) and \\(\\text{Exp}_{\\text{HAP}}\\), and their associated relative risks levels.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.19: Diagram for relative risk due to HAP and OAP exposure\n\n\nSource: Own elaboration\nThe Attributable burden (\\(\\text{AB}\\)) corresponds to the number of cases attributed to the exposure in the population. The AB is calculated by multiplying PAF by the baseline number of health outcomes, for each outcome, sex and age group.\n\\(AB = PAF*Health\\ Outcome\\)\nThe strategy to quantify health effects in CPAT is presented in Section 6.10.3.\n\n\n6.6.3.2 Health outcomes in CPAT\nIn CPAT, we quantify the health effects of pollution as mortality, years of life lost, years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).\nDALY is a summary measure which combines time lost through premature death and time lived in states of less-than-optimal health or “disability”. Figure 6.20 presents an infographic about the DALY metric.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.20: DALY or disability-adjusted life year infographic\n\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons contributors (2020)\nDALY, for a specific cause \\(c\\), sex \\(s\\), age \\(a\\) and year \\(t\\) is defined as indicated in Equation 6.54.\n\\[\\text{DALY}_{c,s,a,t} = \\text{YLL}_{c,s,\\ a,t} + \\text{YLD}_{c,s,a,t} \\tag{6.54}\\]\nThe years of life lost (YLL) are calculated in Equation 6.55 as the number of deaths multiplied by a loss function specifying the years lost for deaths as a function of the age at which death occurs.\n\\[\\text{YLL}_{c,s,\\ a,t} = {\\text{Number}\\ \\text{of}\\ \\text{deaths}}_{c,s,a,t}*L_{s,a} \\tag{6.55}\\]\nWhere \\(L_{s,a}\\) is a standard loss function specifying years of life lost for a death at age \\(a\\) for sex \\(s\\).\nThe years lived with disease (YLD) are measured by the multiplication of the prevalence of the condition25 and a weight factor that reflects the severity of the condition on a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (death) as expressed in Equation 6.56.\n\\[\\text{YLD}_{c,s,a,t} = P_{c,s,a,t}*\\text{DW}_{c,s,a} \\tag{6.56}\\]\nWhere,\n\\(P_{c,s,a,t}\\): Prevalent sequelae for cause \\(c\\), sex \\(s\\), age \\(a\\) and year \\(t\\)\n\\(\\text{DW}_{c,s,a}\\): Disability weight for sequelae for cause \\(c\\), sex \\(s\\) and age \\(a\\)\nCPAT uses incidence at a country level for DALYs, YLL and YLD from Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020).\n\n\n6.6.3.3 Ozone air pollution\nFor ozone health effects, CPAT follows the methodology applied in Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020), which is based on Turner et al. (2016). The health impacts are quantified for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with a RR of 1.06 (1.02, 1.10) per 10 ppb of ozone, in the seasonal (six-month period with the highest mean) 8-h daily maximum concentration metric (6mDMA8h). The TMREL for ozone is defined as ~ U (29.1, 35.7).\nThe relative risk is represented by expression Equation 6.57 and PAF is calculated using expression Equation 6.58.\n\\[RR = e^{\\beta*{\\mathrm{\\Delta}C}_{O3}} \\tag{6.57}\\]\n\\[PAF = 1 - e^{- \\beta*{\\mathrm{\\Delta}C}_{O3}} \\tag{6.58}\\]\nThe change in ozone concentration \\({\\mathrm{\\Delta}C}_{O3}\\) is obtained using the diagonal source-receptor coefficients from TM5-FASST, adjusted from region level to countries using Equation 6.3, from Section 6.5.2; or the “machine learning” model for ozone from Section 6.5.6.\nPrecursors of ozone considered in CPAT are NOx , NMVOC, SO2 and CH4.\n\n\n6.6.3.4 Multiple risks factors\nWhen multiple risks affect the same outcome, we need to apply a multiplicative aggregation of each individual risk, according to Equation 6.59.\n\\[\\text{PA}F_{1..i} = 1 - \\prod_{i = 1}^{n}{(1 - PAF_{i})} \\tag{6.59}\\]\nWhere \\(i\\) corresponds to each individual risk factor.\nIn CPAT, COPD is the only health outcome associated to two different risks (O3 and PM2.5 pollution). Equation 6.60 presents the “corrected” PAF to consider the two risks factors, when aggregating the individual risks.\n\\[\\text{PA}F_{MP2.5 - O3 - COPD\\ } = 1 - \\left( 1 - PAF_{PM2.5} \\right)*(1 - PAF_{O3}) \\tag{6.60}\\]\nWe apply the correction for multiple risks only when we need to add up the effects of PM2.5 and O3. In CPAT, this is done only when valuing (using VSL) total averted mortality.\nThe correction factor is calculated using Equation 6.61.\n\\[\\text{Cor}r_{\\text{factor}} = \\frac{\\text{PA}F_{MP2.5 - O3 - COPD\\ }}{\\text{PA}F_{PM2.5} + PAF_{O3}} \\tag{6.61}\\]\nAdjusted total deaths attributed to PM2.5 and Ozone are calculated by multiplying the \\(\\text{cor}r_{\\text{fact}}\\) by the unadjusted O3 and PM2.5 attributed deaths.\n\n\n\n6.6.4 Baseline exposure to air pollution data\n\n6.6.4.1 Ambient PM2.5 Exposure data\nCPAT will use population weighted average PM2.5 concentrations. In WHO databases, average concentrations are available for rural and urban areas for each country. In most countries, urban populations, in average, are exposed to higher levels of ambient PM2.5. Figure 6.21 presents an example of urban and rural PM2.5 for a group of countries.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.21: Example of urban and rural weighted average concentrations\n\n\nSource: World Health Organization and others (2018)\nIn CPAT, we also use the estimations of ambient PM2.5 from the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020) study. We assume the same ratio between urban and rural concentrations levels from World Health Organization (2018) and the overall concentrations from Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020). Figure 6.22 presents the gridded values for ambient PM2.5 in 2019.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.22: Gridded mean of PM2.5, year 2019\n\n\nSource: Own elaboration, based on Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) (2020) data\n\n\n6.6.4.2 Household PM2.5 Exposure data\nAs we mentioned before, in CPAT we estimate jointly the impacts of ambient and household pollution. To do so, we need to know the share of the population exposed to household pollution and the exposure level to household PM2.5. We again draw upon data from the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020) study.\nThe left panel in Figure 6.23 shows the estimated evolution in the share of the population exposed to household pollution in time, while the right panel presents the exposure level, in addition to the OAP exposure, for the World Bank regions. For the baseline scenario, we assume that the share of the population exposed, and the exposure level will be constant in time, and equal to the estimated value for 2019.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.23: Share of the population (left) and level of additional population (right) exposed to households air pollution\n\n\nSource: IHME/GBD, provided by Michel Brauer\n\n\n6.6.4.3 Ozone Exposure data\nAs mentioned before, we use the seasonal 8 hours maximum daily value to estimate the health effects of ambient ozone pollution. Figure 6.24 presents the gridded concentrations estimated for 2019.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.24: Gridded concentrations of O3, year 2019 (6mDMA8h)\n\n\nSource: Own elaboration, based on data provided by Michael Brauer\n\n\n\n6.6.5 Leakage to biomass\nCarbon pricing to formal fuels could potentially lead to an increase in the use of solid fuels26 for cooking. This is called a “leakage” effect and could increase both household and ambient pollution. Figure 6.25 illustrates the carbon pricing effects on fuels consumption.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.25: Illustration of the impact on carbon pricing in the consumption of fuels\n\n\nSource: Own elaboration\nThe demand for fuels, including the demand for biomass for cooking is calculated in the Mitigation tab in CPAT. For details on energy demand calculations, please refer to the Mitigation tab documentation.\nAs illustrated in Figure 6.25, the leakage into informal fuels could increase the proportion of households exposed to HAP, the level of exposure to HAP and OAP. The assumption for OAP is that 100% of indoor emissions are eventually incorporated into ambient air (Chafe et al. (2014)). These ambient emissions are converted into ambient pollution using the methodology selected by the user, as described in Section 6.5.\nRegarding the indoors effect of solid fuel use, the total leakage is divided in a fraction that increases the proportion of households and a fraction that increases the level of household pollution.\nIn CPAT, the defaults assumptions are that 50% of the increase in informal fuels consumption goes to additional household consuming solid fuels and 50% to increased consumption within households that were already using solid fuels.\nIn many countries is estimated that 90% of households or more use solid fuels for cooking. To make sure that the final proportion of households that uses solid fuels for cooking, after leakage is considered, is less than 100% (or another maximum value defined by the user), we adjust the fraction of the leakage that goes into the proportion of households. Equation 6.62 corresponds to the final proportion of households that uses solid fuels for cooking before adjustments. Equation 6.63 is the adjusted fraction in case the new share of households using solid fuels is higher than the maximum defined. Equation 6.64 is the final proportion of households using solid fuels for cooking.\n\\[\\text{ProportionHH}_{\\text{carbon\\ price}} = \\text{ProportionHH}_{\\text{baseline}}*(1 + Leakage*F_{\\text{pro}p_{\\text{HH}}}) \\tag{6.62}\\]\n\\[{F\\_ prop\\_ HH}_{\\text{adjusted}} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{MaxPropHH}}{\\text{ProportionHH}_{\\text{baseline}}} - 1 \\right)*\\frac{1}{\\text{Leakage}} \\tag{6.63}\\]\n\\[F\\_ prop\\_ HH = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\n\\text{if }\\text{ProportionHH}_{\\text{carbon price}} &gt; Max\\ then{\\ F\\_ prop\\_ HH}_{\\text{adjusted}} \\\\\n\\text{else }\\text{ProportionHH}_{\\text{carbon price}} \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\\  \\tag{6.64}\\]\n\n\n6.6.6 Other health effects in CPAT\n\n6.6.6.1 Post neonatal mortality (Woodruff, Parker, and Schoendorf (2006))\nIn CPAT, it is possible to quantify post neonatal mortality (deaths after the first month and up to 1 year of life) using Woodruff, Parker, and Schoendorf (2006). This logistic function is presented in Equation 6.65, its applied to ambient PM2.5, to all-cause mortality and its parameters are \\(\\beta=0.006765865\\), with \\(\\sigma=0.007338828\\).\n\\[\\left( 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{\\left( 1 - Incidence \\right)*EXP\\left( \\beta*DeltaQ \\right) + Incidence} \\right) \\right)*Incidence*POP \\tag{6.65}\\]\n\n\n6.6.6.2 Depressive disorders\nAnother effect of ambient air pollution included in CPAT is depressive disorders. Braithwaite et al. (2019) develops a metanalysis of studies linking long-term PM exposure and depression. The author develops a log-linear exposure-response function and uses a counterfactual value of 10 µg/m3 for the UK and of 25 µg/m3 for global scenario. In the meta-analysis, the pooled odds ratio for the association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and depression prevalence obtained was 1.102 per 10 µg/m3 (95% CI: 1.023, 1.189; p=0:011), indicating that higher PM2.5 exposure is associated with higher odds of depression.\nThey treat pooled ORs as equivalent to RRs. The relative risk can be calculated according to Equation 6.66.\n\\[RR \\approx \\text{OR}_{10}*\\frac{{PM2.5}_{\\text{current}} - {PM2.5}_{\\text{counterfactual}}}{10} \\tag{6.66}\\]\nWhere \\(OR_{10}\\) denotes the OR per 10 µg/m3 increment in PM2.5 exposure.\nIn CPAT, the counterfactual level, \\({PM2.5}_{\\text{counterfactual}}\\) used is 25 µg/m3."

This methodology has been implemented in more recent literature, such as Holland (2014) and Amann et al. (2017). OECD research OECD (2016) and OECD (2019) has also been based indirectly in Ostro (1987) but referencing the work from Holland (2014).\nThe baseline absenteeism from work due to illness data used are the OECD database “Absence from work due to illness” (OECD (2020)) that covers 46 countries28 and “Absenteeism from work due to illness”29 from the WHO (2019). Figure 6.27 presents the data from the observed databases.\nSince not every country is covered in the databases, we adopt the following assumptions for obtaining baseline absenteeism at a country level:\n\nIf the country in included in the OECD database, we use OECD data.\nIf no OECD data is available, but WHO data includes the country, we use WHO adjusted by “employment to total population ratio, 15+” (ILO n.d.).\nIf no country specific data is available, we use the average value among countries with the same income level.\nFor low-income countries (that are not represented in either database), we use the average from lower middle-income countries.\n\nTo calculate the share of work absenteeism due to illness that can be attributed to ambient PM2.5 pollution, we use the methodology from Ostro (1987). The study developed a log-linear function with \\(\\beta = 0.0046\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\beta} = 0.00036\\). The attributable fraction of working days lost due to pollution is calculated using Equation 6.67 and the total number of days lost due to pollution is given by Equation 6.68.\n\\[PAF = 1 - e^{- \\beta*\\mathrm{\\Delta}C} \\tag{6.67}\\]\n\\[\\text{WDL}_{\\text{pollution}} = \\text{Pop}_{15\\ to\\ 64}*\\text{Per\\ person\\ WDL}_{\\text{baseline}}*(1 - e^{- \\beta*C\\ baseline}) \\tag{6.68}\\]\nWhere \\(\\Delta C\\) is the current level of PM2.5 minus a reference level for PM2.5, that is assumed to be 0 in this case.\nTo value the days of work lost due to pollution, we use mean monthly earnings of employees, ILOSTAT Labor statistics.\nIf no wage is available, the default value used is: \\[Daily\\ wage = \\frac{GDP*\\alpha}{N{^\\circ}\\ of\\ persons\\ employed}*\\frac{1}{N{^\\circ}\\ of\\ days} \\tag{6.69}\\]\nWhere \\(N{^\\circ}\\ of\\ days\\ = 12*20\\).\nWe consider working population from 15 to 64 years old, as in Amann et al. (2017).\n\n\n6.7.3 Market output losses\nIn CPAT, we quantify market output losses using mortality and years lived with disability (YLD) attributed to pollution, following the methodology in Pandey et al. (2021). The methodology followed is presented in the following paragraphs.\nAverage GDP contribution by worker\nEquation 6.70 presents the expected value of GDP per worker in a given year, that we will use to quantify GDP losses due to pollution.\n\\[W_{\\text{ij}} = \\left( \\frac{L_{\\text{ij}}}{N_{\\text{ij}}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{\\text{αY}_{i}}{L_{i}} \\right) \\tag{6.70}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(W_{ij}\\): the expected value of GDP per worker for a person of age \\(j\\) in state \\(i\\).\n\\(\\alpha\\): Labor’s share of GDP\n\\(Y_i\\): GDP\n\\(L_i\\): number of persons who are employed\n\\(N_{\\text{ij}}\\): Population of age\\(\\text{\\ j}\\) in state \\(i\\)\nDue to data limitations, in CPAT will compute a value \\(W\\) for every worker above 15+, without differentiating by age or by urban and rural areas.\nFor each period (year) \\(p\\), the expected GDP from labor per person is calculated using Equation 6.71.\n\\[W_{p} = \\left( \\frac{L_{p}}{N_{p}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{\\text{αY}_{p}}{L_{p}} \\right) = \\ \\frac{\\text{αY}_{p}}{N_{p}} \\tag{6.71}\\]\nLoss in market and non-market output due to air pollution mortality\nLosses in market and non-market output due to air pollution mortality can be estimated according to Equation 6.72.\n\\[{W'}_{ij2017} = \\left( \\frac{L_{\\text{ij}}}{N_{\\text{ij}}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{\\text{αY}_{i}}{L_{i}} \\right) + hp\\left( 1 - \\frac{L_{\\text{ij}}}{N_{\\text{ij}}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{\\text{αY}_{i}}{L_{i}} \\right) \\tag{6.72}\\]\nWhere \\(hp\\) represents household production. In CPAT, due to data limitations, we will only include losses in market output.\nThe present value of the forgone output associated to a premature death is calculated according to Equation 6.73.\n\\[\\text{PV}_{\\text{ij}} = \\sum_{a = j}^{84}\\pi_{ij,t}\\left\\lbrack \\left( \\frac{L_{\\text{it}}}{N_{\\text{it}}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{\\text{αY}_{i}}{L_{i}} \\right) + hp\\left( 1 - \\frac{L_{\\text{it}}}{N_{\\text{it}}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{\\text{αY}_{i}}{L_{i}} \\right) \\right\\rbrack\\left( \\frac{1 + g}{1 + r} \\right)^{t - j} \\tag{6.73}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(\\text{PV}_{\\text{ij}}\\): present discounted value of lost market and non-market output for a person of age \\(j\\) in state \\(i\\) who dies in a certain year\n\\(g\\): growth rate of GDP per worker\n\\(\\Pi_{ij,t}\\) is the probability that a person of age \\(j\\) in state \\(i\\) survives to age \\(t\\)\n\\(r\\): discount rate\nIn CPAT, \\(W_{ij,t} = W_{p}\\) (does not change by age or within countries). We will also consider only deaths up to 64, neglecting work force above 65. These assumptions, together with assuming \\(\\text{hp}=0\\), allow us to rewrite Equation 6.73 as Equation 6.74.\n\\[\\text{PV}_{j} = W*\\sum_{t = j}^{64}\\pi_{j,t}*\\left( \\frac{1 + g}{1 + r} \\right)^{t - j} \\tag{6.74}\\]\nRewriting Equation 6.74, we obtain:\n\\[\\text{PV}_{j}/W = \\sum_{t = j}^{64}\\pi_{j,t}*\\left( \\frac{1 + g}{1 + r} \\right)^{t - j} \\tag{6.75}\\]\nThe total output lost due to air pollution attributed mortality is obtained using Equation 6.76.\n\\[TotalOutputLost = \\sum_{j}^{}{\\text{PV}_{\\text{ij}}D_{\\text{ij}}} \\tag{6.76}\\]\nWith \\(D_{\\text{ij}}\\) the number of deaths attributed to air pollution in state \\(i\\) of age \\(j\\).\nGDP loss due to air pollution morbidity\nIn CPAT, we estimate the years lived with disability due to pollution (see Section 6.6.3.2). We value those years, in which people in working age are not able to work, or the output loss associated with morbidity using Equation 6.77.\n\\[M\\text{ij}\\  = \\ \\ Wij*\\text{YLD}\\text{ij} \\tag{6.77}\\]\nTable 6.14 presents the data sources used for the different productivity parameters needed to quantify output losses.\n\n\nTable 6.14: Parameters for productivity\n\n\nParameter\n\nData sources\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\)\nLabor’s share of GDP\nGuerriero (2019), includes 117 countries.

The probability of survival up to 64 years is calculated as follows: \\[\\pi_{j} = \\prod_{j}^{64}{(1 - \\text{Prob\\ of\\ death}_{j})}\\]\n\n\n\\(g\\)\ngrowth rate of GDP per worker\nILO indicators32, up to 2023: - SDG indicator 8.2.1 - Annual growth rate of output per worker (GDP constant 2010 USD) (%). After 2023, we assume a growth rate equal to the rate in 2023.\n\n\n\\(r\\)\nDiscount rate\nCPAT allows the user to select among 3 options: i) Use the real interest rate for the country, ii) Using a 3% discount rate, as recommended in Robinson, Hammitt, and O’Keeffe (2019), iii) Input manually a discount rate. In case the user selects the first option, r will be the real interest rate33 (%) from the International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics and data files using World Bank data on the GDP deflator34. That data covers 127 countries. Data is available up to 2018. After 2018, it’s assumed an interest rate equal to the average of the rates between 2014 and 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.3.1 CPAT operationalization\nFrom the GBD Results Tool, we obtained deaths probabilities for five-years buckets. For instance, we know the probability of dying between 25 to 29 years old (\\(d_{25,29}\\)). The probability \\(d_{25,29}\\) is equal to the sum of the probability of dying at 25, at 26, at 27, at 28 and at 29 years old, as shown in Equation 6.78.\n\\[d_{25,29} = d_{25} + d_{26} + d_{27} + d_{28} + d_{29} \\tag{6.78}\\]\nFor simplicity and to keep the file size at a reasonable level, we will assume that the probability of dying at every age contained in each bucket is the same, and equal to the bucket dying probability divided by 5, as presented in Equation 6.79.\n\\[d_{25} = d_{26} = d_{27} = d_{28} = d_{29} = \\frac{d_{25,29}}{5} \\tag{6.79}\\]\nThe survival probability for each age inside each age-bucket is presented in Equation 6.80.\n\\[\\pi_{25,29} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{d_{25,29}}{5} \\right) = \\pi_{25} = \\pi_{26} = \\pi_{27} = \\pi_{28} = \\pi_{29} \\tag{6.80}\\]\nTo implement Equation 6.75, let’s do \\(\\left( \\frac{1 + g}{1 + r} \\right) = a\\). Then, Equation 6.75 operationalized for 5 years bucket in CPAT is presented in Equation 6.81.\n\\[\\frac{\\text{PV}_{25 - 29}}{W} = \\pi_{25,29}*\\sum_{k = 0}^{2}a^{k} + \\pi_{25,34}*\\sum_{k = 3}^{7}{a^{k} + \\ldots + \\pi_{25,64}*\\sum_{k = 43}^{47}a^{k}} \\tag{6.81}\\]\nWhere \\(k = t - j\\)\nTo solve the sums inside Equation 6.81, we can apply the following formula:\n\\[\\sum_{k = 0}^{n}{a^{k} = \\frac{1 - a^{n + 1}}{1 - a}} \\tag{6.82}\\]\nEquation 6.82 can be used to solve the sum terms that start in \\(k≠0\\), as shown in Equation 6.83.\n\\[\\sum_{k = m}^{n}{a^{k} = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n}a^{k} - \\sum_{k = 0}^{m}a^{k} = \\frac{1 - a^{n + 1}}{1 - a} - \\frac{1 - a^{m + 1}}{1 - a}} \\tag{6.83}\\]\n\n\n\n6.7.4 Health expenditure\nIn CPAT, we use total expected health expenditure from 2017 to 2050 from the IHME (Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2019a)).\nWe follow Preker et al. (2016) to estimate the share of total health expenditure than can be attributed to pollution. The assumption is a constant expenditure per DALY (Disability adjusted life years).\nIn CPAT, we calculate the share of the total burden of disease that’s attributed to the 6 main causes related to pollution, using data from the GBD Results Tool (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) (2020)). The share of the burden of disease for disease \\(d\\), country \\(c\\) and year \\(t\\), \\(\\% BoD_{d,c,t}\\), is calculated according to Equation 6.84.\n\\[\\% BoD_{d,c,t} = \\frac{\\text{DALY}s_{d,c,t}}{\\text{TotalDALY}s_{c,t}} \\tag{6.84}\\]\nThe total health expenditure attributed to pollution \\(\\text{HEAP}\\) can be calculated using Equation 6.85.\n\\[\\text{HEAP}_{c,t} = \\sum_{d}^{}{\\% BoD_{d,c,t}*PAF_{d,t}*THE_{c,t}} \\tag{6.85}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(\\text{PAF}_{d,t}\\): population attributable fraction for disease \\(d\\) in year \\(t\\)\n\\(\\text{THE}_{c,t}\\): Total health expenditure for country \\(t\\) in year \\(t\\)\n\\(\\text{DALY}s_{d,c,t}\\): Disability adjusted life years, for disease \\(d\\), country \\(c\\) and year \\(t\\)\nIn CPAT, we distribute health expenditure between government, prepaid private, out-of-pocket and development assistance for health using IHME estimations for 2019 (Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2019a)).\n\n\n6.7.5 Value of the statistical life\nIn CPAT, we value averted mortality using the value of the statistical life or VSL. It’s important to notice that the VSL does not represent the value of individual lives. Rather, the VSL is a measure of the rate at which individuals are willing to exchange money to reduce small risks of death within a certain period of time. This concept is used in benefit-cost analyses, and we include it in CPAT to assign a monetary value to averted mortality due to a carbon price policy.\nThe VSL can be transferred following the methodology from OECD (2012) and Narain and Sall (2016), according to Equation 6.86.\n\\[VSL_{c} = VSL_{OECD,2005}*\\left( \\frac{Y_{c}}{Y_{OECD,2005}} \\right)^{b}*\\left( 1 + \\%\\mathrm{\\Delta}P + \\%\\mathrm{\\Delta}Y \\right)^{b} \\tag{6.86}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(c\\): Country to which VSL in being transferred to.\n\\(\\text{VSL}_{OECD,2005}\\): Median VSL in OECD countries in 2005, in 2005 $USD PPP\n\\(Y\\): GDP per capita in PPP\n\\(b\\): Income elasticity for VSL in country \\(c\\)\n\\(\\%\\mathrm{\\Delta}Y\\): Income growth after 2005\n\\(\\%\\mathrm{\\Delta}P\\): inflation according to consumer price index\nIn CPAT, we first transform OECD VSL from 2005 USD PPP to 2011 PPP, using Equation 6.87.\n\\[VSL_{OECD,\\ t,2011PPP} = VSL_{OECD,2005}*\\left( \\frac{Y_{OECD,t}}{Y_{OECD,2005}} \\right)^{0.8}*\\left( 1 + \\%\\mathrm{\\Delta}P_{2005,2011} \\right)^{0.8} \\tag{6.87}\\]\nSecondly, we transfer the OECD VSL from 2014 (in 2011 USD PPP) to the destiny country, according to Equation 6.88.\n\\[VSL_{OECD,\\ 2014} = VSL_{OECD,\\ 2014}*\\left( \\frac{Y_{c,2014}}{Y_{OECD,2014}} \\right)^{b} \\tag{6.88}\\]\nThirdly, we project VSL in time using projected GDP per capita for country \\(c\\), according to Equation 6.89.\n\\[VSL_{c,\\ t} = VSL_{c,2014}*\\left( \\frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,\\ 2014}} \\right)^{b} \\tag{6.89}\\]\nFinally, we convert the VSL from 2011 dollars to dollars in the “Results Year” (equal to 2019), using the 2019 price deflator for the country of destiny.\nIn CPAT, income elasticity is assumed equal to 0.8 for high-income countries and 1.2 for middle and low-income countries. The user can also input manually a different elasticity and a different VSL value in the Advanced tab of CPAT.\nTable 6.15 and Table 6.16 present the values assumed to transfer the VSL from OECD countries.\n\n\nTable 6.15: Assumptions and data sources for VSL transfer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nAssumption\nSource\n\n\n\n\n\\(VSL_{OECD, 2005}\\)\n3 million USD in 2005, in 2005 PPP dollars\nOECD (2012), Table 6.1\n\n\n\\(b\\)\n0.8 for high income countries and 1.2 for middle and low-income countries\nNarain and Sall (2016)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.16: Consumer price index and GDP per capita, OECD countries\n\n\nYear\nCPI OECD\nGDP per head of population OECD (2011 $US PPP)\n\n\n\n\n2005\n82.0\n35,407.8\n\n\n2006\n84.1\n36,248.1\n\n\n2007\n86.2\n36,921.0\n\n\n2008\n89.4\n36,738.5\n\n\n2009\n89.9\n35,198.6\n\n\n2010\n91.5\n36,011.9\n\n\n2011\n94.1\n36,554.1\n\n\n2012\n96.2\n36,813.9\n\n\n2013\n97.7\n37,130.2\n\n\n2014\n99.4\n37,696.5\n\n\n2015\n100.0\n38,413.8\n\n\n2016\n101.1\n38,859.1\n\n\n2017\n103.4\n39,589.2\n\n\n\n\nSource: OECD (2021a) and OECD (2021b)\n\n\n6.7.6 Time Structure of averted deaths\nWhen quantifying and valuing premature mortality, it is often assumed that there is a “cessation lag,” or time distribution of averted mortality after a reduction in exposure (US EPA (2013)). The time structure we selected assumes that 30% of mortality reductions occur during the first year, 50% occurs over years 2 to 5 and 20% over years 6 to 20, after the PM2.5 reduction takes place.\nWhen valuing averted mortality using the value of statistical life (VSL), it is possible to calculate the present value of the benefit from reduced premature deaths by applying the discount rate to the number of deaths themselves and then multiplying by the VSL. In CPAT, the user can select the discount rate among 3 options: i) a discount rate of 3%, consistent with the recommendation in Robinson et al. (2019); ii) a discount rate that represent the interest rate paid by the country’s government and iii) a manual input of discount rate. When using a 3% discount rate, the present value of premature deaths reduced is 0.906 times the number of undiscounted premature averted deaths. When using a higher discount rate, for example a rate of 8%, the factor is reduced to 0.798 (see Table 6.17).\n\n\nTable 6.17: Time distribution of averted premature deaths\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3% discount rate\n8% discount rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeaths distribution in time\nTime discount factor\nFraction deaths*time discount factor\nTime discount factor\nFraction deaths*time discount factor\n\n\nYear 0\n30.0%\n1.00\n0.300\n1.00\n0.300\n\n\nYear 1\n12.5%\n0.97\n0.121\n0.93\n0.116\n\n\nYear 2\n12.5%\n0.94\n0.118\n0.86\n0.107\n\n\nYear 3\n12.5%\n0.92\n0.114\n0.79\n0.099\n\n\nYear 4\n12.5%\n0.89\n0.111\n0.74\n0.092\n\n\nYear 5\n1.3%\n0.86\n0.012\n0.68\n0.009\n\n\nYear 6\n1.3%\n0.84\n0.011\n0.63\n0.008\n\n\nYear 7\n1.3%\n0.81\n0.011\n0.58\n0.008\n\n\nYear 8\n1.3%\n0.79\n0.011\n0.54\n0.007\n\n\nYear 9\n1.3%\n0.77\n0.010\n0.50\n0.007\n\n\nYear 10\n1.3%\n0.74\n0.010\n0.46\n0.006\n\n\nYear 11\n1.3%\n0.72\n0.010\n0.43\n0.006\n\n\nYear 12\n1.3%\n0.70\n0.009\n0.40\n0.005\n\n\nYear 13\n1.3%\n0.68\n0.009\n0.37\n0.005\n\n\nYear 14\n1.3%\n0.66\n0.009\n0.34\n0.005\n\n\nYear 15\n1.3%\n0.64\n0.009\n0.32\n0.004\n\n\nYear 16\n1.3%\n0.62\n0.008\n0.29\n0.004\n\n\nYear 17\n1.3%\n0.61\n0.008\n0.27\n0.004\n\n\nYear 18\n1.3%\n0.59\n0.008\n0.25\n0.003\n\n\nYear 19\n1.3%\n0.57\n0.008\n0.23\n0.003\n\n\nTotal Lag factor\n0.906\n\n0.798\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Own elaboration Note: \\(Time\\ discount\\ factor\\ = 1/(1 + r)^{(t - t0)}\\)\n\n\n6.7.7 Travel time saved\nExcess travel time is one of the consequences of road congestion. In CPAT, we estimate excess travel time, increased road damage, increased injuries, and additional vehicle operating costs attributable to congestion. The methodology used is described in the document Road Transport documentation. Here we only describe the methodology used to quantify changes in travel time, in time units, with respect to free a flow condition.\nWe estimate travel time per vehicle-kilometer in free flow and in congested conditions for 416 cities in 57 countries, using TomTom data (see Equation 6.91 and Equation 6.90). The time domain used is “All Days Full Day”.\nCongestion travel time per vehicle-kilometer, \\(CongestionTT\\), is calculated using Equation 6.90.\n\\[\\text{CongestionT}T_{2019}\\lbrack min/vehkm\\rbrack = \\frac{\\text{AccumulatedTravelTim}e_{2019}\\ \\lbrack min\\rbrack}{\\text{TotalVeh}\\text{KM}_{2019}\\lbrack vehkm\\rbrack} \\tag{6.90}\\]\n\\(\\text{TotalVehicleKM}\\) corresponds to the multiplication of the number of vehicles and the average distance traveled and is reported in the TomTom database.\nThe travel time per vehicle-kilometer under free flow conditions is calculated using Equation 6.91.\n\\[FreeFlowTT\\lbrack\\frac{\\min}{\\text{vehkm}}\\rbrack = \\frac{\\text{CongestionT}T_{2019}\\ \\lbrack\\frac{\\min}{\\text{vehkm}}\\rbrack}{(1 + \\frac{CI_{2019}}{100})} \\tag{6.91}\\]\nWhere \\(\\text{CI}\\) is the average congestion index in 2019.\nWe estimate vehicle-kilometers traveled per capita using total vehicle-kilometers from the World Road Statistics data (International Road Federation (2018)) and countries total population (World Bank (2019b)). For those countries not included in the WRS database, we assume the average vehicle-kilometers traveled per capita between the regional mean and the income level mean.\nUsing vehicle-kilometers traveled per capita, together with the congestion index \\(CI\\) and the free flow travel time, we can estimate total travel time each year \\(t\\), in time units, using Equation 6.92.\n\\[\\text{Travel time}_{t} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{CI_{t}}{100} \\right)*FreeFlowTT\\left\\lbrack \\frac{\\min}{\\text{vehkm}} \\right\\rbrack*VehKm\\ per\\ capita\\left\\lbrack \\frac{\\text{vehkm}}{\\text{year}} \\right\\rbrack*UrbanPopulation_{15 + ,t} \\tag{6.92}\\]\nIn CPAT, there are estimations for the congestion index for each year, under the baseline scenario and a carbon price scenario. Using the Equation 6.92, we can quantify travel time for each year under each scenario. Time savings attributed to a carbon price are equal travel time in the baseline minus travel time in the carbon price scenario.\nWe value those time savings following Robinson et al. (2019). We value travel time at a rate of 50% the after-tax wage rate. We use gross earnings35 data from ILO and then we apply a factor to estimate after-tax wages. The factor used for OECD countries is the “average income tax rate as % of gross wage earnings”. For other countries, we use the average factor from OECD countries, equal to 16%. When we value travel time savings, we do so by considering only the population above 15 years old, since younger population does not participate in the labor market.\nSome implied assumptions: We assume that free flow travel time and vehicle-kilometers traveled per capita are constant in time. Vehicle-kilometers traveled are the same across the population, regardless of age or other considerations. Tomtom’s data is representative of vehicles not using their devices.\n\n\n6.7.8 Value of morbidity using years lived with disabilities (YLDs)\nAnother approach to value morbidity in CPAT in based on a method proposed in Bank (2022). Under this method, we convert YLDs to ‘annual disease days’ \\(M\\) and we value them using a fraction of a country’s daily wage.\nFirst, annual disease days are calculated from YLDs, for each country as:\n\\[M = \\ \\sum_{c = 1}^{n}{YLD_{c}*\\frac{365}{DW_{c}}} \\tag{6.93}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(YLD_{c}\\): years lost to disease \\(c\\)\n\\(DW_{c}\\) : Average disability weight of disease \\(c\\) attributed to PM2.5\nThe cost of a day lived with a disease \\(c\\), \\(c_{c}\\), is calculated a fraction of the daily wage \\(w\\) (in each country), as presented in Equation 6.94. The term D corresponds is set at 0.4, and is associated to the disability weight of a severe condition, with severely restricted work and leisure activity and a substantial medical cost.\n\\[c_{c} = w*\\frac{DW_{c}}{D} \\tag{6.94}\\]\nThe average daily wage, \\(w\\), was calculated using the methodology explained in Section 6.7.3.\nFinally, the cost of morbidity is calculated as the multiplication of annual disease days and the cost of each day lived with disease.\n\\[Cost\\ of\\ Morbidity = \\ \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{c_{c}*M} \\tag{6.95}\\]\nUsing this method to value morbidity attributed to air pollution, we calculate the share of morbidity costs as a share of mortality costs.\n\n\n6.7.9 Air pollution externalities per unit of fuel\nThe health impacts attributed to air pollution are calculated jointly for ambient and household pollution (see Section 6.6.3), following the methodology from Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020). Although the health impacts are estimated jointly, we compute an average externally cost per unit of fossil fuel burnt, which affects only ambient pollution.\nAfter the health impacts have already been quantified, the air pollution externality computation is made as follows:\n\nWe compute the average ambient air pollution attributed mortality per µg/m3 of PM2.5 as total mortality attributed to ambient PM2.5 in a certain year (referred to as “attributable burden” in previous chapters) divided by the total ambient PM2.5 that year.\nUsing the emission factor (for each fuel and sector, for each country) and the emissions-to-concentrations model selected, we compute the ambient PM2.5 contributed by one unit of fuel used (in µg/m3 of PM2.5 per ktoe).\nWe multiply the average ambient air pollution attributed mortality per µg/m3 (step 1) with the ambient PM2.5 contributed by one unit of fuel used (step 2), obtaining the number of attributed deaths by unit of fuel used (deaths/ktoe).\nWe multiply the metric calculated in step 3 with the VSL for the corresponding year and country, obtaining the externality value in dollars per ktoe. We add to this number morbidity costs (for ambient air pollution), according to the methodology described in Section 6.7.8.\nWe convert energy units to express the externality in a commonly used metric for each fuel, considering the relevant calorific values in each country and fuels densities when needed. For instance, for gasoline, the externality is expressed as US$ per liter, while, for coal, the externality is expressed as US$ per GJ."

    "text": "6.9 Caveats\nThe health impacts are calculated using global relative risk functions and global data bases regarding exposure to pollution, baseline incidence and others. Global databases are constructed using country level databases, but in many cases, they are adjusted and standardized. This may lead to differences among the data used in CPAT and local databases. If differences among CPAT and local data is an issue, an advanced Excel user could modify any inputs in CPAT, since the spreadsheet is open, but this would require a deep understanding of the tool.\nAnother issue to be aware of is the national and yearly scope of CPAT. This can be a limitation of CPAT analysis because the dynamics of air pollution can vary widely inside countries and throughout the year. CPAT intends to represent population weighted average air pollution for average pollution during a calendar year.\nAnother caveat is the uncertainty on the calculation of emissions, the relationship between emissions and ambient concentration, the health impacts and the economic values used to monetize the impacts of pollution. CPAT at the time is providing a central estimate for all calculations, without indicating uncertainty on estimations. This caveat could be partially addressed by using the “MT tool” (described in the user guide) to do a sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used.\nIt is important to consider that, even though CPAT performs well when compared to other more complex models, this does not guarantee that CPAT results will always be consistent with other more advance models. We have compared baseline estimates with external global sources, to make sure that we represent the baseline properly. Many checks have been performed in the Mitigation module too, which results drive the air pollution results. These checks do not guarantee that the policy impacts obtained using CPAT will be similar to those obtained from other more complex models. Further checks will need to be performed in a policy/country-specific context. CPAT allows the user to change assumptions and inputs, such that the tool can be adjusted properly when needed.\nOverall, the results from the air pollution in CPAT are conservative in the sense the results are likely underestimating the health impacts of a climate policy. This is the case in big part because the default configuration of the air pollution variables yields conservative contribution from fossil fuels to air pollution. The user can change the predefined options and calibrate the tool to make the results consistent with other sources of information available."

Own elaboration based on Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network (2020)\nIn CPAT, we use the RR values from Table 6.18 and Table 6.19. Since the tables do not include every possible value for PM2.5, we interpolate interpolating between the closest higher and lower values, using Equation 6.96.\n\\[\\text{RR}_{\\text{actual}} = \\text{RR}_{\\text{high}} - \\frac{\\text{RR}_{\\text{high}} - \\text{RR}_{\\text{low}}}{\\text{PM}_{\\text{high}} - \\text{PM}_{\\text{low}}}*(\\text{PM}_{\\text{high}} - \\text{PM}_{\\text{actual}}) \\tag{6.96}\\]\n\n\n6.10.3 Quantification of health effects in CPAT\nThe RR associated with exposure to household (and ambient) pollution in the baseline, \\(\\text{RR}_{\\text{HAP}}^{0}\\), can be expressed as the baseline mortality rate for those exposed to HAP (and OAP) , \\(\\lambda_{\\text{HAP}}^{0}\\), divided by the mortality rate that would be observed in the absence of pollution, \\(\\lambda_{\\text{TMREL}}\\). This relationship is presented in Equation 6.97.\n\\[\\text{RR}_{\\text{HAP}}^{0} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{HAP}}^{0}}{\\lambda_{\\text{TMREL}}} \\tag{6.97}\\]\nIn the same way, the RR associated with exposure to ambient pollution in the baseline, \\(\\text{RR}_{\\text{OAP}}^{0}\\), can be expressed as the baseline mortality rate for those exposed to OAP, \\(\\lambda_{\\text{OAP}}^{0}\\), divided by the mortality rate that would be observed in the absence of pollution, \\(\\lambda_{\\text{TMREL}}\\).

The comments in the table do not include those where reviewers were already in agreement with CPAT. Most comments and answers are a summary of the original version.\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\nResponse 2021\n\n\nResponse 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncidence rate vs. incidence proportion\n\n\nThe methodology document provided the definitions for key technical terms, including that for the incidence rate, which forms part of the overall method used in calculating the burden of disease. However, the definition presented in the document seems to be referring to the incidence proportion and not the rate. In epidemiological terms, there is a distinction between the two measures\n\n\n\nThanks for the precisions made on the definitions for incidence proportion and rate. We did use the correct measures, following the GBD study. We will correct the documentation.\n\n\nThe comment was incorporated into CPAT documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAge-group considerations for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)\n\n\nThe methodology currently considers all age groups combined for LRTI estimates and relies on the same Integrated Exposure Response (IER) function across the board for this outcome. Exposure to household air pollution almost doubles the risk for childhood pneumonia and is responsible for 45 percent of all pneumonia deaths in children less than 5 years of age. Household air pollution is also a risk for pneumonia in adults, and contributes to nearly 28 percent of all adult pneumonia-related deaths. Given implications from the application of carbon pricing, especially in relation to leakage to biomass, and households opting to use solid fuels for cooking and heating as a result, mortality estimates among those in the under 5 years old age-group is likely to increase. Therefore, stratifying LRTI cause-specific mortality by age-group to capture this specific age-group would be of extremely high relevance – even more so from an operational perspective.\n\n\n\nWe fully agree that a disaggregated analysis by age group, in buckets of five years would be the best approach, and even more disaggregated to include neonatal effects. Unfortunately, in CPAT we are working with more aggregated age groups: Under 15, 15 to 24, 25 to 64, above 65, and neonatal. We did this aggregation due to limited file size in the tool. Because of this, we cannot differentiate the effects among children under 5, but hopefully we will use a more disaggregated analysis in the CPAT version outside Excel.\n\n\n\nAs before, more detailed disaggregation is not feasible in the Excel version of the tool. But the aggregates estimate of CPAT replicate well the results obtained with more disaggregated data.\n\n\nIn countries with high household pollution, after a carbon price we generally obtain a net reduction in health effects, despite increase household health effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering methodology applied in the Household Air Pollution Intervention Tool (HAPIT) to estimate health benefits\n\n\nThe team provided a comparison between HAPIT and CPAT, concluding that CPAT is based on more recent methodologies, but HAPIT does a better job differentiating exposure among women, children and men. This element could be added in a future CPAT version, developed outside Excel.\n\n\nAs before, regarding household pollution (not the focus of CPAT), no additional disaggregation is possible, to consider different exposure patterns among women, children and men. Regrettably we are already at the limit of Excel capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nThe CPAT dashboard is user-friendly and is easy to navigate. It is unclear, however, where and how to update certain parameters should the need arise (e.g. changes in IER functions, or in VSL estimates) or to allow for country-specific inputs. To this end, a more detailed user manual would be extremely valuable to have.\n\n\nWe hope that a few months of testing (with the team involved in each study) would give us a good idea of whether the tool can be roll out to other teams (and what type of training and support may be needed).\n\n\nNow we have produced a user’s guide, that intends to guide the user about policies configuration and parameters settings. This guide corresponds to Chapter 1 of CPAT documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Emissions – concentrations – health outcomes:\n\n\nOf course, and the team is keenly aware of this, CPAT has to rely on simplified ways of modelling the complex relationships (such as for example using intake fractions instead of using chemical transportation modelling of relating emissions to concentrations), but for a policy tool, this in my view is certainly more than good enough. That said, I wonder if in the future we can experiment with going beyond intake fractions\n\n\n\nBesides intake fractions, we have included other options to relate emissions and concentrations: i) TM5-FASST model, ii) Source apportionment information, in combination with TM5-FASST results and iii) Elastic Net and OLS model. We are also in the process of implementing in CPAT the results of a machine learning modeling to related emissions and concentrations, by emitting source type.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the models indicated during the previous review, we have added the following models to relate emissions to concentration: i) a machine learning methodology (simplified) and ii) Average of intake fractions and source apportionment in combination with TM5-FASST.\n\n\nWe have also expanded the source apportionment studies available in CPAT.\n\n\n\n\n\nI appreciate the effort made to show how CPAT’s figures correspond to IIASA’s, EDGAR’s and GBD’s, and think those are useful symmetries to show. That said, I do want to point out that this does not imply that the impact of a certain EFR on air pollution and health outcome would deliver the same results whether it’s impact is modelled with CPAT or the more complex models.\n\n\nWe have compared the air pollution module baseline estimates with external global sources, to make sure that we represent the baseline within the results from other more complex models. You are right that these checks do not guarantee that the policy impacts modeled in CPAT will be similar to the policy impacts obtained from other more complex models. Further checks will need to be performed in a policy/country-specific context and we have made sure that the tool allows the user to change assumptions and inputs, such the tool can be adjusted properly when needed.\n\n\nWe added a section of “caveats” to the documentation that includes this point.\n\n\n\n\nI am currently looking at the relationships between air pollution and infant mortality, globally, as part of an ASA activity. We will be producing a concentration-response curve for this relationship, which you may choose to include into CPAT as an alternative to the GBD function.\n\n\nSure, we can add this new concentration-response curve for infant mortality in CPAT.\n\n\n\nThe paper is currently in the process of being published and the focus was on the impact of PM2.5 on increased pregnancy stunting (rather than infant mortality). This outcome can negatively affect children even after they recover from stunting.\n\n\nAt this stage, we cannot include this effect in CPAT, but we already have children and neonatal health effects in the tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pollution model includes plenty of interesting information. The direct economic link is via the reduction in labor supply and deaths related to pollution. However, there are in effect two mechanisms at play - which could be added. The first is associated with the extensive margin - i.e. the number of employed individuals not going to work due to illness. The second is related to the intensive margin - the reduction in the number of productive hours worked. This is important in a country context where affected laborers tend to be low-skilled and where laborers can be drawn from an unemployed pool and put to work immediately (the case where employing the services of an unemployed worker to replace the affected worker is costless). If this is the case, then the direct pollution effect on labor could be negligible.\n\n\nHowever, if all workers are exposed to pollution, then what matters is the intensive margin - i.e. the work effort. Reducing pollution will have an extra benefit to society - increased labor effort and more efficient means of production regardless of the substitutability of labor.\n\n\nAt the moment the CPAT tool describes the economic benefit or reducing pollution in terms of disability adjusted life years. This is an extensive margin concept where labor rotation rates are not accounted for (i.e. the probability of drawing an unskilled worker from the unemployment pool to replace the sick worker). Accounting for these rotation rates complicates the modeling but adds another element of realism. The economic cost will no longer be associated with DALY’s multiplied by income, but with DALY’s adjusted for labor replacement effects, multiplied by incomes.\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your comments and suggestions. We agree that the “intensive margin” effect can be more relevant, due to a generalized drop in labor effort when workers are exposed to pollution. There is evidence that, besides working days lost and DALYs (both included in CPAT), productivity may decrease among workers that do attend to work. The drop in productivity has been studied in different working settings and locations of the world (see table below). We have not yet incorporated the results from the different studies into CPAT. The results of the last paper in the table (Fu, Viard, and Zhang 2017) could be implemented, if we believe that country specific results could be extrapolated and used in other countries.\n\n\nMoreover, there is growing evidence on cognitive effects of air pollution in adults (Allen et al. 2017; Zhang, Chen, and Zhang 2018) and neurodevelopment issues children (WHO 2018), affecting human capital formation. This implies that air pollution has both short term and long-term effects in productivity, but so far, we have not been able to incorporate them in CPAT.\n\n\n\nAs before, although the literature on productivity effects of pollution is growing, we still face the issue of location and setting specific studies, that cannot confidently be extrapolated to a global setting, for broad sectors of the economy.\n\n\n\n\nWhen cooking fuels are exempt, the spill-over effects on consumption of various fuels particularly biomass, and the resulting health (and other development) effects should be accounted for if possible.\n\n\nThanks for this comment. Exactly, we allow the user to exempt, or rather rebate, cooking fuels in order to alleviate concerns of spill-over effects into increased biomass use. For the proportion of the consumption for which no exemption is chosen, at present we model explicit substitution into biofuels with carbon pricing (not modelled when these fuels are exempt). So, we are able to see the modelled differences in health effects between carbon price and non-carbon price (with and without exemptions).\n\n\nThis point was clarified during the previous review\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a list of the changes made in CPAT, between the 2021 review (in March) and August 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nDevelopments\nAdditional summary metrics of externalities (per unit of fuel burned), for additional fuels and sectors\n\n\n\nAdditional indicators of externalities related to years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disabilities (YLD)\n\n\n\nAdditional indicators of externalities differentiating for population in working age\n\n\n\nInclusion of the marginal impact on global temperature, compared to emissions level of the baseline year\n\n\n\nNew source apportionment studies were added\n\n\n\nNew average method to relate emissions to concentrations: average of intake fractions and local-study/TM5-FASST\n\n\n\nNew metrics about the total damage of pollution as share of GDP, using VSL and forgone output\n\n\n\nNew option to adjust baseline year results (2019) to GBD 2019 study\n\n\n\nAdditional VSL options\n\n\n\nImplementation of the results from machine learning method, for PM2.5 and ozone to relate emissions to concentrations in the different sectors.\n\n\n\nFor household pollution, we added a projected HAP level and exposure, based in historical trends\n\n\n\nThe relative risk functions were extended to up to 2000 ug/m3\n\n\nOther changes\nEmissions of local pollutants were moved to the mitigation module\n\n\n\nNew emission factors for CO2, other GHGs and local pollutants\n\n\n\nChanges in graphs with results\n\n\n\nDashboard results now include in their title a link to the results in the air pollution tab\n\n\n\nChange to a different baseline year\n\n\n\nMany modifications to run CPAT using the Multi Scenario tool\n\n\n\nDefinition of default options to configure the air pollution tab\n\n\n\nCorrections in case modeled concentrations are above observed ones (issue arising from emissions to concentration models being calibrated with different data bases)\n\n\n\nChanges to more efficient (faster) formulas\n\n\n\nStandardization of codes (for diseases, risks, etc.)\n\n\nFixes\nMany small fixes in formulas\n\n\n\nRuns to check errors that arises for particular countries\n\n\n\nCorrections to the calculation of GWP100, affected by corrections in emission for biofuels and methane.\n\n\n\nCorrection of the average emission factors option, to calculate emissions for local air pollution health effects\n\n\n\nCorrection of the externality of LPG.

    "text": "7.1 Summary\nCarbon taxes impact fuel prices and thereby shape driving behavior. In particular, carbon taxes increase incentives to substitute away from private vehicles towards more fuel-efficient means of transport. As road traffic has many externalities aside carbon emissions, carbon taxes may lead to a reduction in road transport-related externalities such as congestion, accidents and road damage. To estimate the magnitude of these co-benefits, the CPAT Road Transport Module quantifies the effect of a user-defined carbon tax or road fuel tax on (a) the intensity of congestion as measured by the time lost relative to free-flowing traffic, (b) the number of road fatalities, and (c) the maintenance cost due to road damage.\nThe Road Transport Module is based on elasticities that we estimate using an international country-year level dataset. This dataset is compiled from many sources and describes road transport, as well as general demographics and economic variables. The dataset covers the time from 1994 to 2021 and 186 countries, so that we can use within-country and between-country variation for identification. We estimate elasticities with respect to fuel prices and with respect to fuel taxes, as well as short and long-run elasticities. We estimate country-specific elasticities based on global coefficients and country-specific covariates.\nThe magnitude of the resulting elasticities are broadly in line with the literature: for a 10% fuel price increase from a carbon tax, total vehicle-km traveled decrease in the short run on average by 2.8 %; congestion levels decrease by 3.4 %; accident fatalities decrease by 6.1 %; and road damage decreases by 4.4 % in the long run.\nThe estimated elasticities are used within CPAT to produce policy forecasts of total vehicle-km traveled, congestion levels, accident fatalities and road damage cost. By choosing a country and inputting different parameters for a policy in the dashboard, the user obtains a series of graphs showing the time series with and without the policy, as well as the policy impact defined by the difference of the two time series.\nImportant caveats of the CPAT Road Transport Module include the assumed linearity of effects, which may potentially not apply to large policy changes. Moreover, econometrically estimated elasticities take the historic capital stock as given and do not predict the impact of disruptive technological changes such as electric vehicles (EVs). Finally, CPAT does not measure the externality cost of non-realized trips."

    "text": "7.3 Introduction\nAside carbon emissions, road transport causes various externalities. The most important transport externalities examined here are congestion, road damage and accidents. These externalities are not the explicit target of carbon taxes, but also decline when the total distance traveled declines. Such reductions in externalities occur as a “side effect” to the direct goal of a carbon tax and are commonly called co-benefits (Parry et al. (2014)).\nAs a tool for assessing the overall impact of carbon tax reforms across the globe, CPAT predicts the magnitude of these co-benefits, among others for the transport sector. The methodology relies on econometric estimations of long-run and short-run elasticities of externalities with respect to fuel prices. The fuel price change induced by a carbon tax is then multiplied by the elasticities to predict the transport co-benefits of the carbon tax policy.\nThe following sections will first give an overview over the relevant literature; then present the data sources used and explain the methodology for estimating the elasticities of externalities with respect to fuel prices. In a next section, we will present the estimation results on three transport externalities: congestion, road damage and accidents. Finally, we present the Excel implementation of this work in CPAT.\n\n7.3.1 Vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT)\nWe do not consider VKT (analogous to the US American vehicle-miles traveled, VMT) a policy target per se but include it in order to illustrate one of the main channels through which fuel prices affect congestion, road damage and accidents. Reductions in VKT may be a result of people transitioning to less transport-intensive activities, other transport modes, in particular public/collective transport options, closer workplaces and residence location choice (Molloy and Shan (2013)).\nIn particular, a carbon tax may incite passengers to travel together, such that a reduction of vehicle-km may be achieved without a reduction in passenger-trips, by increasing the rate of passengers per vehicle. Bento, Hughes, and Kaffine (2013) show that the average number of users increases with fuel prices, because users carpool (i.e. share a vehicle) more. Carbon taxes may also deter detours, so that vehicle-km, and even passenger-km, may be reduced without a reduction in passenger-trips (see Figure 7.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Schematic representation of the link between carbon tax and VKT\n\n\nNote: Channels (in orange boxes) are shown to illustrate the economic theory; they are not modeled/estimated separately within CPAT.\nThe negative relationship between fuel prices and VKT is well established in the economics literature. The literature provides a large number of empirical estimates of the elasticity of VKT wrt fuel prices. Table 7.1 lists a selection of these estimates: most commonly, the estimates of VKT elasticity range from -0.05 to -0.50. A review paper found the mean estimate to be -0.10 in the short run and -0.29 in the long run (Goodwin, Dargay, and Hanly (2004)).\nSome of these responses take time, so the long-run gasoline price elasticity of road deaths is likely to exceed the short-run elasticity. However, high fuel prices also push consumers to invest into more fuel-efficient vehicles, either buying cars that are more efficient or switching from cars to motorcycles (or other modes). In this case, the literature has extensively discussed the importance of the rebound effect, defined as efficiency induced consumption or, more plainly, the idea “buy a more fuel-efficient car, drive more” (Gillingham, Rapson, and Wagner (2016)). The rebound effect might cause long-run VKT elasticity to be lower than short-run VKT elasticity.\n\n\nTable 7.1: Literature estimates of the elasticity of VKT wrt fuel prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nCountry\nFuel price elasticity of road use\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort run\nLong run\n\n\n\nUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall and Van Dender (2007)\nUS\n-0.05\n-0.22\nVKT elasticity.\n\n\nBurger and Kaffine (2009)\nUS\n-0.16\n\nVKT elasticity during peak congestion hours in Los Angeles.\n\n\nBento, Hughes, and Kaffine (2013)\nUS\n-0.05\n\nRoads without carpool lanes in Los Angeles.

Adapted from Burke, Batsuuri, and Yudhistira (2017) and Moshiri (2020).\n\n\n7.3.2 Congestion\nCongestion is the result of interaction between the limited vehicle capacity of a given facility and the demands for space by individual users. The costs of congestion occur in the form of excess travel time, increased expected damage and injury from accidents among vehicles, and additional vehicle operating costs for wear and fuel (Murphy and Delucchi (1997)).\nThe relationship of total VKT to congestion is straightforward (see Figure 7.2): the less vehicles on the road, the smaller the congestion problem (Sugiyama et al. (2008)). This theoretical relationship has been documented in the literature for decades (Johnson (1964)). When people share vehicles (carpooling) or substitute to public transport, the reduction in congestion may be achieved with constant total passenger-km (Bento, Hughes, and Kaffine (2013)).\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Schematic representation of the link between carbon tax and congestion\n\n\nNotes: Channels (in blue boxes) are shown to illustrate the economic theory; they are not modeled/estimated separately within CPAT.\nEmpirically, congestion has been difficult to measure until very recently. Conventional measurement methods are costly, such as employing humans to count, establishing cameras or installing wires on the road. The resulting measurements only cover a limited number of precise locations and often only short periods of time. More recently, the development of mobile communication technology has allowed newer measures such as the congestion indicators of Waze, Google Maps, Inrix and TomTom. These GPS-based data cover larger areas over long periods of time and are highly disaggregated.\nGiven the limited/recent availability of congestion data, the empirical literature on the impact of fuel prices on congestion levels is relatively scarce. Burger and Kaffine (2009) find that a USD 1 increase in fuel prices reduces congestion and raises average freeway speeds by approximately 7% during rush-hour periods. They estimate short-run elasticity with a methodology similar to ours and find estimates ranging from -0.12 to -0.29. In an older study, Dahl (1979) finds an estimate of -0.35 for the elasticity of speed wrt fuel price. Cohen and Roth (2017) find that higher diesel prices lead to less but heavier trucks on the road, thereby reducing congestion.\nBurke, Batsuuri, and Yudhistira (2017) examine the reaction to a fuel tax reform in Indonesia and find a fuel price elasticity of motor vehicle flows (number of vehicles on toll roads) between –0.1 and –0.2. They estimate that Indonesia’s fuel subsidy reforms of 2013 and 2014 have reduced traffic pressure by around 10%, relative to the counterfactual without reform.\nThe externality cost of congestion can be measured in monetary equivalent by multiplying time lost in traffic congestion by the value of travel time (Abrantes and Wardman (2011)).\n\n\n7.3.3 Road accident fatalities\nRoad traffic injury is now the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 years. It is the eighth leading cause of death for all age groups surpassing HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and diarrheal diseases (World Health Organization (2018)).\nRoad accidents are a function of factors including road user behavior, road characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and the distances driven (vehicle-kilometers traveled, VKT) on roads by different types of drivers. Research has also shown that economic variables affect road accident risk exposure. Among these, fuel prices and key macroeconomic measures such as the unemployment rate have been the focus of prior studies rates (Ahangari et al. (2014); Gerdtham and Ruhm (2006); International Transport Forum (2015)). The negative effect of fuel prices on the risk of fatal accidents is well established in the literature.\nFor international comparisons, the literature considers data on fatalities more reliable than data on the number of accidents and number of injuries (Luoma and Sivak (2007); Sauerzapf, Jones, and Haynes (2010); World Health Organization and others (2013)). This is why most studies concentrate on deadly crashes, when trying to assess the relationship of fuel prices and road accidents. Chi et al. (2010) is a notable exception to this rule.\nThe relationship from fuel prices (and thus taxes) to accidents is multifactorial (see Figure 7.3), as shown in Chi, Porter, et al. (2013). Several aspects may be summarized to a principal channel which is VKT. Reduced driving decreases the exposure of both vehicle occupants and others to road crashes.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Schematic representation of the link between carbon tax and accidents, adapted from Chi, Porter, et al. (2013)\n\n\nNote: Channels (in red boxes) are shown to illustrate the economic theory; they are not modeled/estimated separately within CPAT.\nIn addition to reducing VKT, higher gasoline prices might also lead to a reduction in road deaths per kilometer driven. One reason is that, to conserve fuel, drivers might reduce high-speed driving and so-called “aggressive driving” (high rates of acceleration and braking). Another reason is that high-risk drivers, including the young, the old, and those taking leisure-related trips, are particularly sensitive to gasoline prices (Morrisey and Grabowski (2011); Sivak (2009)). Higher gasoline prices also result in substitution from heavier to lighter, more fuel-efficient cars, which are associated with a lower overall number of road deaths per kilometer traveled (Gayer (2004); White (2004)). Substitution to bus travel may also reduce overall road safety risks.\nHowever, through other channels higher gasoline prices might actually lead to more rather than fewer road deaths. Higher gasoline prices reduce congestion and thereby increase average speed (Burger and Kaffine (2009)), which increases the risk of fatal crashes. Fuel price-induced substitution to motorcycles, which are more fuel-efficient, may also cause additional road deaths (Hyatt et al. (2009); Wilson, Stimpson, and Hilsenrath (2009)). In particular, substitution to lighter cars and motorcycles would explain why long-run elasticities of accidents wrt fuel prices would be smaller in absolute magnitude than short-run elasticities.\nMany studies in this field concentrate on the United States. Some authors argue that the effect of higher gasoline prices on road deaths operates via a reduction in VKT (Grabowski and Morrisey (2004)), whereas others report also a reduction in road deaths per VKT (Chi et al. (2010); Chi, Quddus, et al. (2013); Grabowski and Morrisey (2006); Haughton and Sarkar (1996); Montour (2011); Sivak (2009)). Sivak (2009) explains this reduction by the disproportionate reduction in leisure driving (riskier than commuter driving) and rural driving (more risky than urban driving).\nLeigh and Wilkinson (1991) examine the relationship between gas price, gas tax, and road fatalities for all 50 states using a multiple regression framework. They find that a 1% increase in gas tax leads to a 0.18% to 0.20% reduction in road fatalities, but that gas prices are not statistically significant in explaining road fatalities. They use a different method, using cent-per-gallon rather than a log-log specification as does this study. A later study by Grabowski and Morrisey (2004), using 1983 to 2000 state-level data and a panel model to investigate the relationship between gas prices and road fatalities, finds that a 1% increase in gasoline prices reduces road fatalities by 0.23%. Looking only at Mississippi, Chi et al. (2010) finds a short-run elasticity of -0.25 and a long-run elasticity of -0.47. For Minnesota, Chi, Quddus, et al. (2013) find an elasticity of -0.219 for fatal crashes wrt to fuel prices and their estimates are higher in rural areas than in urban areas.\nIn an international study, Burke and Nishitateno (2015) find a 1% increase in the gasoline pump price would reduce road fatalities by 0.3% to 0.6%. Around 35,000 road deaths per year could be avoided by the removal of global fuel subsidies. Litman (2012) presents a scatterplot for 16 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries that shows a negative association between average gasoline prices and traffic fatality rates. Using a panel model of 16 industrialized countries, Ahangari et al. (2014) find an elasticity of -0.22 after controlling for VKT.\nOther country-specific short-term elasticity estimates include -0.2 to -0.3 for New Zealand (Best and Burke (2019)) and -0.2 for Australia (Burke and Teame (2018)).\nIn a dynamic urban model, Avner, Rentschler, and Hallegatte (2014) examine the impact of carbon taxes on urban mobility and underline the lock-in effect from public transport investments: while the quality of urban transport infrastructure is difficult to capture quantitatively, we include data on satisfaction with public transport in our elasticity estimation to account for this effect.\n\n\n7.3.4 Road damage\nRoad damage depends strongly on road usage (Jacobson and Wågberg (2005)), but not all vehicles affect road damage equally: wear and tear on the pavement is a rapidly rising function of a vehicle’s axle weight (Jacobson and Wågberg (2005); Murphy and Delucchi (1997); Parker and Hussain Ph D (2006); FHWA (2000)). Estimations suggest that the pavement wear and tear of one average five-axle truck equates to approximately 4,000 cars (Freight & Infrastructure (2014)). Therefore, nearly all of the vehicle-caused road damage is attributable to heavy-duty vehicles (trucks).\nIn most countries around the world,1 light-duty vehicles (cars) use gasoline and trucks use diesel. Road damage is thus more dependent on diesel price than on gasoline price.\nThe externality cost of road transport from pavement wear and tear has been discussed extensively in the economics literature, going back as far as Adam Smith (Lindsey (2006)). There is a consensus that diesel is strongly under-taxed, when comparing tax level to externality cost (Parry (2008); Santos (2017)).\nMany authors have suggested addressing it directly through different forms of road pricing explicitly indexed on road damage cost (e.g. Newbery (1988); Parker and Hussain Ph D (2006); Santos et al. (2010)). From an economist’s point of view, addressing the externality explicitly, with taxes mirroring the externality cost directly, is the first best solution. However, as a carbon tax also increases diesel prices, it decreases truck VKT and thereby reduces road damage (Barla, Gilbert-Gonthier, and Kuelah (2014); ; Wadud (2016)). In general, a carbon tax reduces all road transport externalities that depend on VKT (Ekins (1996)).\nThe strength of this co-benefit depends on the elasticity of truck VKT with respect to fuel prices/taxes. There is large evidence that trucks reduce their VKT when fuel prices rise. Let us cite just a few recent studies finding significantly elastic VKT for trucks: Barla, Gilbert-Gonthier, and Kuelah (2014) find short and long-run price elasticities of -0.43 and -0.80 respectively; He (2015) estimates a VKT elasticity of -0.54; Ramli and Graham (2014) estimate short-run price elasticity between -0.11 and -0.16, long-run elasticity between -0.21 and -0.30 for trucks; Leard et al. (2015) find estimates around -0.20.\nSome studies find that the elasticity depends on the type of trucks: Wadud (2016) finds that rigid trucks show statistically significant price elasticity, but articulated trucks do not respond to changes in fuel prices.\nOn the opposite, some authors find that trucks are relatively inelastic with regards to fuel prices (Winebrake et al. (2015)). One study finds that higher diesel prices are associated with fewer but heavier trucks, and therefore more road damage (Cohen and Roth (2017)).\nIn practice, two cost components to road damage may arise: the cost of repairing the pavement damage, and the additional cost to users, which result from traveling on damaged roadways. Given the difficulty to measure the second component, we concentrate on the first component in CPAT.\nMethodologically, it is important to note that some countries earmark revenues from fuel taxes or road charges for road maintenance (Gultom et al. (2017)). In these countries, our estimation technique is not valid because of endogeneity, so that we exclude them.\nQuantitatively, road damage may be considered the smallest of the three transport externalities considered here.\n\n\n7.3.5 Within-country heterogeneity (by socio-demographic characteristics)\nRegarding the within-country heterogeneity of the effect of fuel price on VKT, the literature has not reached a consensus. Within countries, Bastian and Borjesson (2014) find that urban populations, in particular those with low incomes, respond stronger to fuel price increases and economic downturn, i.e. are reducing car travel more. Similarly, many studies find that (absolute) elasticity diminishes with higher income levels (Santos and Catchesides (2005); Small and Van Dender (2007); West (2017)). On the opposite, Wang and Chen (2014) find that higher income households show greater fuel price elasticity than lower income households.\nRegarding the effect of fuel prices on accident fatalities, the literature suggest that the poor are more often victims of road accidents because of the vehicles they travel in. There is evidence that larger vehicles (in particular light trucks and SUVs) cause more fatalities than light passenger vehicles, while drivers of SUVs are relatively more protected: (White (2004)) calls this disequilibrium “the ‘Arms race’ on American roads”. The highest risk is borne by motorcyclists who tend to have lower incomes than four-wheeled vehicle drivers (Hyatt et al. (2009)). A particular group at high risk for road death are young drivers (aged 15–24) and their passengers. As these drivers are more sensitive to fuel prices, the young drivers accident rate responds particularly strongly to fuel price increases (Morrisey and Grabowski (2011)). One of the few studies looking at gender and race, Chi et al. (2010) find that fuel prices affect accident rates similarly for men and women, as well as for white and black population.\n\n\n7.3.6 Between-country heterogeneity\nRegarding the between-country heterogeneity of the effect of fuel prices on VKT, most estimates concentrate on developed countries, in particular the USA. Studies on developing countries often face data challenges, but so far the literature suggests that the elasticities lay within the same order of magnitude in developed and developing countries (Gillingham, Rapson, and Wagner (2016)).\nRegarding the effect of fuel prices on accident fatalities, some studies look at differences between high- and low-income countries, but the literature on within-country determinants of road fatalities and their elasticity wrt to fuel prices is scarce. Data is notoriously more scarce in developing countries. Country-level panel data identification strategies such as used in Burke and Nishitateno (2015) typically yield one elasticity for all countries. A priori, the effect is unclear: wealthier individuals travel larger distances and thus have a higher risk of traffic accidents, but poorer individuals travel more on foot and on motorcycles, which increases their risk to die from a road accident.\n\n\n7.3.7 Fuel prices vs. taxes\nMost of the above mentioned literature examines the effect of fuel prices on the various outcomes discussed. However, for CPAT we are interested in the effect of a carbon tax.\nRegarding the effect on VKT, Li, Linn, and Muehlegger (2014) show that gasoline consumption responds more strongly to gasoline taxes than to gasoline prices. They explain that consumers may respond more to taxes than equal-sized changes in tax-inclusive gasoline prices because of perceived persistence and salience. Variation in gasoline taxes also is covered much more intensively in the media.\nRegarding road fatalities, Leigh and Wilkinson (1991) show that gasoline taxes have a significant effect on fatalities while the effect of price effect from oil market fluctuations is not significant. However, these findings are on a cents-per-liter basis rather than a percent basis, so they are not directly comparable to our results.\n\n\n7.3.8 Methodology\nLiterature generally finds that the short-term elasticity of fuel use is weaker than the long-term elasticity wrt fuel prices (Chi et al. (2010)). Usually, researchers explain this finding by structural adjustments to the vehicle fleet, travel demand (work and residence locations) and infrastructure. Hence, there has been some methodological effort to estimate short-run and long-run elasticities separately.\nThe methodology for elasticity estimation in the Road Transport Module is similar to Burke and Nishitateno (2015). Using country-year-level data, the main estimations are fixed effects and between estimators of a linear log-log equation. The between estimator uses average data for each country and provides estimates of long-run effects (Badi Hani Baltagi and Baltagi (2008); Badi H. Baltagi and Griffin (1984); Pesaran and Smith (1995); Pirotte (1999); Stern (2010)). Fixed-effects estimations control for time-invariant factors such as the extent of mountainous terrain, but when a static fixed-effects equation is estimated the coefficients represent short-run effects. This method has been widely used in the literature looking at the effect of fuel prices on road safety (Best and Burke (2019); Burke and Nishitateno (2015); Grabowski and Morrisey (2006); Montour, 2011). An alternative way of estimating long-run elasticities is the distributed lag specification (Burke and Nishitateno (2015); Chi, Porter, et al. (2013); Montour (2011)).\nOther studies, e.g. Chi, Quddus, et al. (2013), use more time-series related methods, in particular testing for unit roots and accounting for stationarity. These methods are difficult to implement with unbalanced panels, as in our case. However, in his standard econometrics textbook (Badi Hani Baltagi and Baltagi (2008); Badi H. Baltagi and Griffin (1984)) considers that time-series methods should apply when T (the number of periods) is large and N (the number of countries) is small, whereas panel data methods like the between estimator are appropriate when T small and N large: “Using panel data, one can avoid the problem of spurious regression\\(…\\) Unlike the single time series spurious regression literature, the panel data spurious regression estimates give a consistent estimate of the true value of the parameter as both N and T tend to \\(\\infty\\). This is because, the panel estimator averages across individuals and the information in the independent cross-section data in the panel leads to a stronger overall signal than the pure time series case.”"

    "section": "7.4 Data sources",
    "text": "7.4 Data sources\n\n7.4.1 General\nWe use a panel dataset of country-year-level data, including as many countries and years as available, resulting in an unbalanced panel. The dataset covers the time from 1994 to 2021 and 186 countries around the world.\nThe main data source are the World Road Statistics (WRS), regularly published by the International Road Foundation (International Road Federation (2018)). We use data from its editions 2001 to 2021, covering the years 1995 to 2019.\nAside many of our covariates, WRS also contains two of our outcomes of interest: we use total distance driven in vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) and road damage, as measured by infrastructure maintenance investment.\nGeneral demographic and macroeconomic variables are provided by the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database.2 The World Bank’s World Governance Indicators (WGI) database3 gives indicator measures of corruption and rule of law.\nThe online database for Sustainable Development Report (SDR) 20194 (Sachs et al. (2019)) gives an indicator of the quality of public transport.\nWeather information at the country-year level is provided by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, downloadable via the World Bank’s Climate Change Knowledge Portal (CCKP).5 We use the precipitation (in mm), the minimum temperature (in °C), the number of hot days (Tmax&gt;40°C), and the number of ice days (Tmax&lt;0°C).\nAll monetary variables are deflated to 2018 USD using the World Bank’s US GDP deflator and adjusted for purchasing power parity (WDI).\nAn exhaustive list of variables with their sources can be found in Section 7.10.1.\n\n\n7.4.2 Congestion\nTraffic congestion is measured using the TomTom Traffic Index. This index covers over 400 cities across 61 countries. The TomTom Traffic index statistics are calculated from anonymized GPS data collected via navigation devices, in-dashboard systems and smartphones.\nThe congestion level percentages represent the measured amount of extra travel time experienced by drivers across the entire year. As a first step, TomTom establishes a baseline of travel times during uncongested, free flow conditions across each road segment in each city. They then analyze travel times across the entire year for each city. The TomTom Traffic Index then represents the difference between observed travel times and free flow travel time.\nFor example, an overall congestion level of 36% means that the extra travel time is 36% more than an average trip would take during uncongested conditions. Average times are of actual taken trips, across every vehicle in the entire network, 24/7. Travel times in free-flow (uncongested) conditions are not based on legal speed limits but on actual trips made.\nThe TomTom Traffic Index is available both overall, as well as for specific weekdays and peak times, including morning and evening peak hours.\n\n\n7.4.3 Road safety\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)6 and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)7 provide statistical databases, used to complete missing data points in the WRS, in particular for accident fatalities.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) publishes reports on Road Safety. We use the 2013 edition with data on 2011 (World Health Organization and others (2013)) and the 2018 edition with data on 2017 (World Health Organization (2018)), which include detailed covariates on the legal framework of traffic, such as seat belt wearing rate, blood alcohol concentration limit, helmet enforcement and others.8\nFor Côte d’Ivoire and Mexico, country-specific projects made more detailed accident data available, which are included in the general CPAT analysis. Missing data for Côte d’Ivoire in WRS are completed using the national accident statistics provided by the Ivorian Ministry of Transport. Unrealistically low accident numbers for Mexico in WRS are replaced by data from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) and the Mexican Transport Institute (IMT).\n\n\n7.4.4 Fuel prices\nFuel prices are taken from the fuel price database of the overall CPAT project. For road fuels, the sources used are the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), Enerdata’s Global Energy and CO2 Data, IEA’s Data and statistics and GIZ’s Sustainable Urban Transport Project.\nIn combining these different data sources, the following order of steps is applied:\n\nIf Enerdata, IEA and IMF data is available, we establish a weighted average of price data in Enerdata (60%), IEA (10%) and IMF (30%);\nif IMF or IEA are missing, we use Enerdata;\nIf Enerdata is missing, we use the information in the IMF database;\nIf IMF is missing, we use the information in the IEA database;\nIf IEA is missing, we use the information in the GIZ database.\n\nAside the final retail price at the pump, we use data on taxes summarizing VAT, existing carbon taxes, excise tax and others. We use the same algorithm as described above for prices to construct time series of fuel taxes. Supply cost is defined as the difference of price at the pump minus taxes.\n\n\n7.4.5 Externality costs\nThe benefits of prevented mortalities can be expressed in terms of a “Value of a Statistical Life” (VSL), which represents the value a given population places ex ante on avoiding the death of an unidentified individual. VSL is based on the sum of money each individual is prepared to pay for a given reduction in the risk of premature death, for example from diseases linked to air pollution OECD (2012).\nThe country-specific VSL in CPAT is adapted from OECD (2012), adjusted for GDP growth and inflation (within the Air Pollution Module).\nWe compute the average speed from TomTom’s total VKT and total travel time. We then compute the VKT per capita from WRS’ national VKT divided by the population size from the WB’s World Development Indicators (WDI). This average VKT per capita is multiplied by the size of urban population over 15 year of age (WDI) and divided by the average speed, yielding total urban travel time.\nThe total urban travel time is then multiplied by 80% of the average hourly after-tax wages (from Air Pollution Module), yielding the value of travel time.\n\n\n7.4.6 Data cleaning\nSeveral variables result of the combination of several data sources. For example, we combine information on accident fatalities from WRS, OECD and UNECE. In these cases, we define a clear order and only “fill up” missing variables with the second and third source.\nAfter establishing this mix of data sources, a visual control of country-specific time series is performed to identify outliers. For each visually identified outlier, we perform thorough background checks and in case of doubt only keep one source (resulting in some limited data loss).\nStock variables such as length of road network, country area or size of population are interpolated linearly when missing between years with non-missing data for that country. However, we do not extrapolate beyond the last/first year with non-missing data. The variable table in Section 7.10.1 indicates for which variables such interpolation is performed."

    "text": "7.5 Methods for elasticity estimation\nThis chapter explains the general methodology for estimating short- and long-run elasticities and making them country-specific in a data-parsimonious way. This methodology is then applied to VKT and the three outcomes of interest: congestion, road damage and fatalities from road accidents.\n\n7.5.1 Estimation equation\nWe regress the logarithm of the outcome variable onto a constant, the logarithm of fuel prices, a list of covariates and fixed effects. The general form of the estimated regression estimation is\n\\[\\ln\\left( Y_{\\text{ct}} \\right) = \\alpha + \\beta\\ln\\left( p_{\\text{ct}} \\right) + \\gamma\\ X_{\\text{ct}} + \\mu_{t} + \\mu_{c} + \\epsilon_{\\text{ct}} \\tag{7.1}\\]\nWhere \\(\\ln\\left( Y_{\\text{ct}} \\right)\\) is the natural logarithm of the outcome in country \\(c\\) in year \\(t\\), \\(\\ln{(p_{\\text{ct}})}\\) is the natural logarithm of pump price for gasoline, \\(X_{\\text{ct}}\\) is a vector of covariates including income per capita and population density, and \\(\\mu_{c}\\) and \\(\\mu_{t}\\) are country- and year-specific effects.\nAn elasticity measures how much an outcome changes relatively to its initial value (e.g. in percent) when another variable, here the pump price of gasoline, changes (in percent). As we are using the log-log specification, the coefficient estimate \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\) in Equation 7.1 is an estimate of the elasticity of the outcome \\(Y_{\\text{ct}}\\) with respect to (wrt) fuel prices \\(p_{\\text{ct}}\\).\n\n\n7.5.2 Short-run and long-run estimators\nFollowing Burke and Nishitateno (2015), we consider that the within estimator from a static fixed-effects equation represents shorter-run effects, and the between estimator provides estimates of long-run effects (Badi Hani Baltagi and Baltagi (2008); Badi H. Baltagi and Griffin (1984); Pesaran and Smith (1995); Pirotte (1999); Stern (2010)).9\nFor simplicity, let us reduce the notation of the previous equation (Equation 7.1) to:\n\\[y_{\\text{ct}} = \\alpha + \\beta x_{\\text{ct}} + \\mu_{c} + \\epsilon_{\\text{ct}} \\tag{7.2}\\]\nWhere the logarithms have been omitted and all righthand-side variables summarized under the vector \\(x_{\\text{ct}}\\).\nThe interpretation for the long and short run is based on the idea that the previous Equation 7.2 may alternatively be formulated:\n\\[y_{\\text{ct}} = \\alpha + \\beta'{\\overline{x}}_{c} + \\beta''(x_{\\text{ct}} - {\\overline{x}}_{c}) + \\mu_{c} + \\epsilon_{\\text{ct}} \\tag{7.3}\\]\nWhere \\({\\overline{x}}_{c}\\) is the average of \\(x_{\\text{ct}}\\) over time: \\({\\overline{x}}_{c} = \\sum_{t}^{}{x_{\\text{ct}}/T_{c}}\\), where \\(T_{c}\\) is the number of years included for country \\(c\\) in the regression.\nIn the model described by Equation 7.3, we postulate that changes in the average value of \\(x_{\\text{ct}}\\) for an individual country may have a different effect from temporary departures from the average. The model allows a different response to permanent rather than transitory changes. If \\(\\beta' = \\beta''\\), then the model in Equation 7.3 collapses into the previous model in Equation 7.2.\nWhatever the properties of \\(\\mu_{c}\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{\\text{ct}}\\), if Equation 7.2 is true, we can take the averages and find that:\n\\[{\\overline{y}}_{c} = \\alpha + \\beta'{\\overline{x}}_{c} + \\mu_{c} + {\\overline{\\epsilon}}_{c} \\tag{7.4}\\]\nwhere \\({\\overline{y}}_{c}\\) is the average of \\(y_{\\text{ct}}\\) over time: \\({\\overline{y}}_{c} = \\sum_{t}^{}{y_{\\text{ct}}/T_{c}}\\) and \\({\\overline{\\epsilon}}_{c}\\) is the average of the error term: \\({\\overline{\\epsilon}}_{c} = \\sum_{t}^{}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ct}}/T_{c}}\\).\nSubtracting Equation 7.4 from Equation 7.3, it must also be true that:\n\\[{y_{\\text{ct}} - \\overline{y}}_{c} = \\beta''{(x_{\\text{ct}} - \\overline{x}}_{c}) + (\\epsilon_{\\text{ct}} - {\\overline{\\epsilon}}_{c}) \\tag{7.5}\\]\nThese equations are known from panel econometrics textbooks: Equation 7.4 describes the between estimator and Equation 7.5 describes the within estimator, also known as fixed-effects estimator.\nFixed-effects estimations control for time-invariant characteristics of countries such as the extent of size or mountainous terrain. As illustrated in Equation 7.5, the identifying variation comes from within-country deviations from the country-mean. Given standard assumptions on the error term \\(\\epsilon_{\\text{ct}}\\) (mean\\(\\ 0\\), uncorrelated with itself, uncorrelated with \\(x_{\\text{ct}}\\), uncorrelated with \\(\\mu_{c}\\), and homoscedastic), the within estimator can be estimated as an OLS on Equation 7.5 or, equivalently, an OLS on Equation 7.1 including country dummy variables. For this study, this equation is estimated using the Stata command xtreg, fe.\nThe between estimator is given by the OLS estimator on Equation 7.4. This specification cancels out time-differences. The between estimates are based on cross-sectional country differences. Individual-invariant regressors such as time dummies cannot be identified. For this project, this equation is estimated using the Stata command xtreg, be.10\n\n\n7.5.3 Covariates\nThe choice of the variables used as covariates \\(X_{\\text{ct}}\\) follows the list of variables used in World Health Organization (2018). A detailed list can be found in Section 7.10.1.\n\n\n7.5.4 Country-specific elasticity estimates\nThe effect of fuel prices on our three outcomes of interest is likely to be heterogeneous across different countries. However, there is limited data available for most countries, so that unparametrically country-specific estimations proved not feasible. We discard to option to create ad hoc regional groups and estimate group-specific elasticities, as we want a more data-driven methodology. To strike a balance between accounting for heterogeneity and using available data parsimoniously, we estimate elasticities that are linear expressions of several covariates.\nThe estimation includes interaction terms between fuel prices and the additional variables. For example, if elasticity depends on two more variables, the estimation equation is:\n\\[\\ln\\left( Y_{\\text{ct}} \\right) = \\alpha + \\beta_{0}\\ln{(p_{\\text{ct}})} + \\beta_{1}v_{\\text{ct}}^{1}\\ln{(p_{\\text{ct}})} + \\beta_{2}v_{\\text{ct}}^{2}\\ln{(p_{\\text{ct}})} + \\gamma\\ X_{\\text{ct}} + \\mu_{c} + \\ \\mu_{t} + \\epsilon_{\\text{ct}} \\tag{7.6}\\]\nwhere the variables are the same as before, and\\(\\ v_{\\text{ct}}^{1}\\) is the first additional variable influencing elasticity and \\(v_{\\text{ct}}^{2}\\) is the second additional variable influencing elasticity. The “country-specific” elasticity estimated is then:\n\\[{\\widehat{\\beta}}_{c} = {\\widehat{\\beta}}_{0} + {\\widehat{\\beta}}_{1}\\overline{v_{c}^{1}} + {\\widehat{\\beta}}_{2}\\overline{v_{c}^{2}} \\tag{7.7}\\]\nwhere \\(\\overline{v_{c}^{1}}\\) is the average across recent years11 of variable \\(v_{\\text{ct}}^{1}\\) for country \\(c\\) (and analogously for variable \\(\\overline{v_{c}^{2}}\\)). In practice, we include not two but five additional variables \\(v_{\\text{ct}}^{k}\\), which we omit here for readability.\nWe consider 15 candidate variables linked to traffic conditions, demographics and availability of substitutes to private vehicles. The final estimations include only the variables found to be empirically most important.\nThe selection of covariates \\(v_{\\text{ct}}^{k}\\) included in the expressions of elasticities is data-driven using a lasso regression as implemented in Stata command lasso2 (Ahrens, Hansen, and Schaffer (2020)). The lasso procedure penalizes additional variables/parameters and thereby encourages simple, sparse models, i.e. models with fewer parameters. The algorithm sequentially includes one variable after the other, in an optimized order. The order in which predictors are entered into the model can be interpreted as an indication of the relative predictive power of each predictor.\n\n\n7.5.5 Fuel prices or taxes\nWe are interested in the effect of carbon taxes on accidents. The most classical way of estimating tax impact consists in estimating price elasticity from exogenous price variation. However, some of the literature states that consumers might not react identically to price changes and to tax changes (salience, anticipation of persistence over time).\nTherefore, we estimate two sets of elasticities: elasticities wrt fuel prices and wrt fuel taxes. The estimation for elasticity wrt to prices follows the equations above. The estimations for elasticity wrt to taxes include the natural logarithms of both tax-exclusive prices and taxes as two separate variables. The elasticity of interest is then the estimated coefficient of the tax variable. Fuel tax data is only available for a limited amount of countries."

For the full results, please refer to the Tran_Elas sheet of CPAT.\n\n7.6.1 Congestion\nFigure 7.4 shows descriptive evidence of the relationship between urban congestion and gasoline prices: across countries, there is a significant negative correlation in 2018.12 Congestion is measured with the TomTom Traffic Index, indicating the additional time spent in congested traffic as compared to free-flowing traffic (in percent, see Section 7.4.2 for more details).\nThis simple descriptive evidence omits many variables. In particular, the elasticity of demand of private vehicle trips depends on the availability of (and practicability) alternative means of transport. Moreover the resulting congestion depends on whether these alternative means of transport will also be on the road (e.g. buses) or elsewhere (e.g. trains).\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Scatter plot and linear regression of urban congestion as a function of gasoline prices in 2020\n\n\nSource: Tomtom, Enerdata, EIU, IEA, own computations.\n\n7.6.1.1 Short-run elasticity\nThis section shows the results for the short-run estimations of congestion on fuel prices and a list of covariates.

The parameter marked in green is the default short-run elasticity in CPAT for countries that have not sufficient data for country-specific elasticity estimation. Sample averages are subtracted from the interaction variables prior to interacting with the fuel price.\nTable 7.2 shows results of the pooled OLS (column 1-3) and within estimator (column 4-6). For each estimator, we compute the coefficient first without and then with covariates included. All of the estimates lie within a similar order of magnitude: the short-run elasticity of congestion wrt fuel price is estimated between -0.08 and -0.29. This is very close to the estimates ranging from -0.12 to -0.29 in Burger and Kaffine (2009) and more inelastic than the estimate of -0.35 in Dahl (1979).\nThe columns 4 and 6 show the results of including additional interaction terms between the fuel price and selected variables. The coefficient of the fuel price is not directly interpretable in this specification. In order to obtain country-specific elasticity estimates, one needs to multiply the coefficients with the country-specific values of the covariates. The results are given below in Section 7.6.1.3.\n\n\n7.6.1.2 Long-run elasticity\nComputing the between estimator of Equation 7.1, given by Equation 7.4, we obtain the long-run elasticity.\n\n\nTable 7.3: Regression results long-run congestion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban congestion\n(1)\n(2)\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween estimator\n\n\n\n\nLn of gasoline pump price (2018 PPP-adj USD cents/liter)\n-0.125***\n-0.364***\n-0.707\n\n\n\n(0.00436)\n(2.07e-08)\n(0.214)\n\n\nInteraction ln(gasoline) w/ Maximum speed on urban roads (in km/h)\n\n\n0.260\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.129)\n\n\nInteraction ln(gasoline) w/ Precipitation (in mm)\n\n\n0.0821\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.421)\n\n\nInteraction ln(gasoline) w/ Seat-belt wearing rate (%)\n\n\n-0.105\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.326)\n\n\nInteraction lnsuper w/ Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)\n\n\n-0.906**\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.0394)\n\n\nInteraction ln(gasoline) w/ Ln of population\n\n\n-0.0210\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.934)\n\n\nCovariates\nNo\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInteraction terms\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\nObservations\n583\n467\n467\n\n\nR-squared\n\n\n0.786\n\n\nNumber of countries\n61\n52\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobust p-values in parentheses, *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1. Ln(gasoline) is the natural logarithm of the gasoline pump price (2018 PPP_adjusted USD cents/liter). The parameter marked in green is the default long-run elasticity in CPAT for countries that have not sufficient data for country-specific elasticity estimation. Sample averages are subtracted from the interaction variables prior to interacting with the fuel price.\nAgain, the first two columns of Table 7.3 show the estimates first without and then with covariates included into the regression. The third column shows the results of including the interaction of fuel price with the empirically relevant covariates, which are not directly interpretable and will be discussed in the next subsection.\n\n\n7.6.1.3 Country-specific elasticities\nTable 7.2 and Table 7.3 show the results of regressing congestion on fuel prices and covariates, estimating the short-run (within estimator) and long-run (between estimator) elasticities. The parameters of the last column of each table give the results of including interaction terms with relevant covariates, as described by Equation 7.6. The most relevant interaction terms are chosen using lasso regressions (see Section 7.3.8 for methodology).\nWhile using fuel price data for estimating elasticity is standard in the literature, some authors have suggested that consumers react more strongly to changes in fuel taxes than to (equivalent) changes in fuel prices. This hypothesis typically relies on additional salience of taxes, which are often strongly featured in the media, and on expectations about the persistence of the price change into the future.\nTherefore, we repeat the same estimations of Table 7.2 and Table 7.3 using fuel supply cost and fuel taxes as two separate variables, rather than overall fuel price at the pump. Detailed results are omitted here, but can be found in the MS Excel file appendix to this report.\nAs a result, we have four elasticity estimates for each country: short-run and long-run, each wrt prices and wrt taxes.\nTable 7.4 shows the lists of variables which are selected by the lasso regression algorithm as the five most relevant covariates for fuel price elasticity of congestion. The elasticities depend on characteristics of the vehicle fleet (number of vehicles per capita, share of motorcycles), on characteristics of the road network (density, speed limits), characteristics of transport substitutes (satisfaction with public transport) and on more general features of society (population size, rule of law indicator, urbanization, share of young people, and others).\n\n\nTable 7.4: Variables selected for country-specific congestion elasticity estimation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort run\nLong run\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwrt price\nwrt tax\nwrt price\nwrt tax\n\n\nLn of number of vehicles per capita\nNumber of vehicles per capita\nMaximum speed on urban roads (in km/h)\nMaximum speed on urban roads (in km/h)\n\n\nSatisfaction with public transport (%)\nSatisfaction with public transport (%)\nLn of population\nLn of population\n\n\nShare of paved roads (in %)\nShare of urban population (in %)\nInfant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)\nInfant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)\n\n\nLn of population\nSeat-belt wearing rate (%)\nSeat-belt wearing rate (%)\nSatisfaction with public transport (%)\n\n\nPrecipitation (in mm)\nMaximum speed on urban roads (in km/h)\nPrecipitation (in mm)\nRoad density (in km per km2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: The covariates used for estimating the country-specific elasticities are chosen by a data-driven machine learning algorithm among a list of 30 candidate variables.\nGiven the large number of countries and variants, the elasticities are not reproduced here. The detailed numbers can be found in CPAT or in the MS Excel appendix to this report.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Country-specific congestion elasticities, graphical overview\n\n\nFigure 7.5 shows the kernel densities13 of the congestion elasticity estimates in the short and the long-run, wrt fuel price and wrt fuel tax. One can see that congestion is more elastic to fuel prices in the long run than in the short run. This is a classical result, as consumers have the possibility to adjust more in the long run than in the short run.\nTable 7.5 summarizes the key characteristics of the distributions shown in Figure 7.5: mean, median, 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution.\n\n\nTable 7.5: Country-specific congestion elasticities, numerical overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban congestion\nShort-run\nLong-run\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwrt price\nwrt tax\nwrt price\nwrt tax\n\n\nDefault elasticity\n-0.288\n-0.118\n-0.364\n-0.119\n\n\nMean\n-0.339\n-0.305\n-0.807\n-0.612\n\n\nMedian\n-0.340\n-0.296\n-0.798\n-0.531\n\n\n5th percentile\n-0.433\n-0.381\n-1.001\n-1.127\n\n\n95th percentile\n-0.242\n-0.229\n-0.667\n-0.294\n\n\nNumber of estimates\n158\n151\n174\n154\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6.2 Fatalities from road accidents\nFor illustration, Figure 7.6 shows descriptive evidence of the negative correlation between fuel prices and road accident fatalities.

Our estimates are similar to the short-run estimate of (Burke and Nishitateno (2015)) with -0.10. The columns 3 and 6 include the interaction terms and are not directly interpretable; the resulting country-specific elasticities are discussed in Section 7.6.2.3.\n\n\n7.6.2.2 Long-run elasticity\n\n\nTable 7.7: Regression results long-run accident fatalities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccident fatalities\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween estimator\n\n\n\n\nLn of gasoline pump price (2018 PPP-adj USD cents/liter)\n-0.214**\n-0.192***\n0.123\n\n\n\n(0.0322)\n(2.18e-09)\n(0.432)\n\n\nInteraction ln(gasoline) w/ Ln of number of vehicles per capita\n\n\n-0.150\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.438)\n\n\nInteraction ln(gasoline) w/ Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres\n\n\n0.179\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.210)\n\n\nInteraction ln(gasoline) w/ Number of motorcycles per capita\n\n\n0.0909\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.461)\n\n\nInteraction ln(gasoline) w/ GDP per capita (in 2018 PPP-adj USD)\n\n\n0.0124\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.936)\n\n\nInteraction ln(gasoline) w/ Share of urban population (in %)\n\n\n0.0690\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.465)\n\n\nCovariates\nNo\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInteraction terms\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\nObservations\n3,240\n2,035\n2,035\n\n\nR-squared\n0.880\n0.900\n0.919\n\n\nNumber of countries\n170\n\n138\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobust p-values in parentheses, *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1.

The parameter marked in green is the default long-run elasticity in CPAT for countries that have not sufficient data for country-specific elasticity estimation. Sample averages are subtracted from the interaction variables prior to interacting with the fuel price.\nThe long-run elasticity estimates in Table 7.7 lie between -0.19 and -0.21 (column 1 and 2). This is less elastic than the estimates of (Burke and Nishitateno (2015)) with -0.30 to -0.60. The third column cannot be directly interepreted and is discussed in the following subsection.\n\n\n7.6.2.3 Country-specific elasticities\nTable 7.8 shows the lists of variables which are selected by the lasso regression algorithm as the five most relevant covariates for the elasticity of accident fatalities, chosen by a data-driven algorithm. Again, the elasticities depend on characteristics of the vehicle fleet, on characteristics of the road network and on more general features of society. In particular, motorcyclist are known to be at particularly high risk for accident injury and death. Classical road safety features such as seat-belt wearing rate, alcohol consumption and maximum speed allowed also play a role. More broadly, GDP and infant mortality rate capture the general development situation of the country, as well as the quality of the country’s health system.\n\n\nTable 7.8: Variables selected for country-specific accident elasticity estimation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort run\nLong run\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwrt price\nwrt tax\nwrt price\nwrt tax\n\n\nNumber of vehicles per capita\nLn of number of vehicles per capita\nGDP per capita (in 2018 PPP-adj USD)\nGDP per capita (in 2018 PPP-adj USD)\n\n\nPopulation share of 15 to 24 years-old (in %)\nPopulation share of 15 to 24 years-old (in %)\nAlcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol)\nAlcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol)\n\n\nSatisfaction with public transport (%)\nInfant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)\nShare of urban population (in %)\nShare of urban population (in %)\n\n\nRoad density (in km per km2)\nNumber of motorcycles per capita\nLn of number of vehicles per capita\nNumber of motorcycles per capita\n\n\nSeat-belt wearing rate (%)\nMaximum speed on rural roads (in km/h)\nNumber of motorcycles per capita\nMaximum speed on rural roads (in km/h)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: The covariates used for estimating the country-specific elasticities are chosen by a data-driven machine learning algorithm among a list of 30 candidate variables.\nFigure 7.7 shows the distribution of country-specific accident elasticity estimates.

The underlying hypothesis is that all road damage is repaired and therefore captured by the road maintenance budget of the government, as opposed to road investment for the expansion of the road network.\nCompared to the other two outcomes previously discussed, road damage presents the particularity to be more dependent on diesel price than on fuel price. Although the differential impact of a carbon tax on fuel and gasoline prices is relatively small, we thus use diesel prices in this section rather than gasoline prices as before.\n\n7.6.3.1 Short-run elasticity\nThe results of road damage in the short run are not significant. They are included in the MS Excel appendix to this report, but within CPAT we assume the short run elasticity of road damage wrt fuel prices to be zero.\n\n\n7.6.3.2 Long-run elasticity\nIn the long run, road damage costs react to diesel prices, but the results are not statistically significant as shown in Table 7.10. In the simple specifications (columns 1 and 2), the elasticity is around -0.3. We use the parameters estimated in the specification including interaction terms (column 3) in order to compute the country-specific elasticities for CPAT presented in the next subsection.\n\n\nTable 7.10: Regression results long-run road damage costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoad damage\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween estimator\n\n\n\n\nLag of ln of diesel pump price (2018 PPP-adj USD cents/liter)\n0.0957\n-0.269\n0.819\n\n\n\n(0.862)\n(0.735)\n(0.156)\n\n\nInteraction ln(diesel) w/ Minimum of daily min-temperature (in B0C)\n\n\n0.352\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.397)\n\n\nInteraction ln(diesel) w/ Total length of road network (in km)\n\n\n-1.476***\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.00177)\n\n\nInteraction ln(diesel) w/ Share of paved roads (in %)\n\n\n-0.947**\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.0431)\n\n\nInteraction ln(diesel) w/ Share of urban population (in %)\n\n\n0.391\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.277)\n\n\nInteraction ln(diesel) w/ Number of lorries and vans\n\n\n0.563\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.677)\n\n\nCovariates\nNo\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInteraction terms\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\nObservations\n1,321\n1,039\n1,039\n\n\nR-squared\n0.726\n0.803\n0.914\n\n\nNumber of countries\n118\n103\n103\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobust p-values in parentheses, *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1.

Sample averages are subtracted from the interaction variables prior to interacting with the fuel price.\n\n\n7.6.3.3 Country-specific elasticities\nAs shown on Table 7.11, the long-run road damage elasticities depend on structural features of the country’s transportation system (population density, total road network, urbanization), on the vehicle fleet, particularly larger vehicles, and rule of law. Additionally, weather plays an important role for road damage. In particular, minimum temperatures seem to impact the effect of a carbon tax: with less traffic, the effect of low temperatures (frost) on road damage is reduced.\n\n\nTable 7.11: Variables selected for country-specific road damage elasticity estimation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong run\n\n\n\n\n\nwrt price\nwrt tax\n\n\nNumber of lorries and vans\nNumber of lorries and vans\n\n\nTotal length of road network (in km)\nTotal length of road network (in km)\n\n\nShare of urban population (in %)\nShare of urban population (in %)\n\n\nShare of paved roads (in %)\nRoad density (in km per km2)\n\n\nMinimum of daily min-temperature (in °C)\nPopulation density (people per sq. km of land area)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: The covariates used for estimating the country-specific elasticities are chosen by a data-driven machine learning algorithm among a list of 30 candidate variables.\nFigure 7.8 shows that the estimates using fuel taxes suggest less elasticity of road prices wrt fuel taxes than the estimates using prices at the pump. Overall, virtually all estimates lie above -1, suggesting a less than one-to-one reaction of road damage to changes in fuel prices.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: Country-specific road damage elasticities, graphical overview\n\n\nTable 7.12 summarizes the key characteristics of the distributions shown in Figure 7.8.\n\n\nTable 7.12: Country-specific road damage elasticities, numerical overview\n\n\nRoad damage\nLong-run\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwrt price\nwrt tax\n\n\nDefault elasticity\n-0.269\n-0.497\n\n\nMean\n-0.440\n-0.335\n\n\nMedian\n-0.415\n-0.284\n\n\n5th percentile\n-0.768\n-0.699\n\n\n95th percentile\n-0.187\n-0.173\n\n\nNumber of estimates\n170\n178\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6.4 Vehicle-km travelled (VKT)\nWe analyze the effect of fuel prices on VKT in order to illustrate one of the main channels through which fuel prices affect congestion, accidents and road damage. We do not consider VKT a policy outcome per se and the effect of fuel prices on the other outcomes is calculated directly (not via the VKT elasticities).\n\n7.6.4.1 Short-run elasticity\nThe estimated short-run elasticities of VKT wrt fuel price are shown Table 7.13.

    "text": "7.7 Excel implementation: CPAT’s Road Transport Module\n\n7.7.1 General\nThe Road Transport Module takes as an input the road fuel price changes induced by the policy indicated by the user in the dashboard. The module then computes changes in VKT, congestion, accidents and road damage and presents them graphically in the dashboard tab. The information flow is schematized in Figure 7.10. Although the effect on VKT is computed, the other outcomes are modeled directly as a function of price, in order to avoid having to take functional form assumptions on the influence of VKT and its interaction with the other channels.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10: Input and output of CPAT’s Road Transport Module\n\n\nNote: Channels are shown to illustrate the economic theory; they are not modeled/estimated separately within CPAT. The estimated elasticities result of the interaction of all channels in the data.\n\n\n7.7.2 Baseline forecasts\nIn order to graphically represent changes induced by the policy compared to a baseline, we must first establish a baseline forecast. The methodology in CPAT is identical for all three outcomes and VKT. It follows the following structure:\n\nEstablish a linear forecast based on the average growth rate of available (often incomplete) time series of the variable in the past;\n\nThe sheet “Tran_Data” contains recent values of the outcome variables as well as the geometric average of growth rates over the past years.\n\nAdjust the variable’s linear forecast:\n\nfor (forecasted) future deviations from (observed) average past GDP growth using the estimated elasticity of the outcome wrt GDP,\nfor (forecasted) future deviations from (observed) average past population growth using the estimated elasticity of the outcome wrt population.\n\n\n\\[Y_{t}^{\\text{baseline}} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{GDP}_{t}}{\\text{GDP}_{t - 1}} - \\overline{g^{\\text{GDP}}} \\right)^{\\eta_{\\text{GDP}}}{\\left( \\frac{\\text{pop}_{t}}{\\text{pop}_{t - 1}} - \\overline{g^{\\text{pop}}} \\right)^{\\eta_{\\text{pop}}}Y}_{t}^{\\text{simple}} \\tag{7.8}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(Y_{t}^{\\text{baseline}}\\) is the baseline (without policy) forecast of variable \\(Y\\),\n\\(Y_{t}^{\\text{simple}}\\) is the “naïve” linear forecast based only on past observed values of \\(Y\\),\n\\(\\text{GDP}_{t}\\) and \\(\\text{GDP}_{t - 1}\\) are the contemporary and previous GDP (GDP growth forecast for coming years from IMF World Economic Outlook),\n\\(\\overline{g^{\\text{GDP}}}\\) is the expected GDP growth (geometric average growth over past years),\n\\(\\eta_{\\text{GDP}}\\) is the elasticity of the outcome wrt GDP,\n\\(\\text{pop}_{t}\\) and \\(\\text{pop}_{t - 1}\\) are the contemporary and previous population sizes (WB Population Estimates and Projections),\n\\(\\overline{g^{\\text{pop}}}\\) is the expected population growth (geometric average growth over past years),\nand \\(\\eta_{\\text{pop}}\\) is the elasticity of the outcome wrt population size.\n\nWe need to subtract expected GDP/population growth from the actual (forecasted) GDP/population growth, as the past growth rates are implicitly included in the linear forecast \\(Y_{t}^{f}\\).\nAdjusting for GDP growth in this way should allow us to account for booms and recessions, as for example the graphically impressive drop caused by Covid-19.\n\n\n7.7.3 Policy forecast\nThe impact of the carbon policy depends on the change in fuel prices and the variable’s elasticity wrt fuel prices/taxes.\nThe fuel price is computed as follows:\n\nthe baseline road fuel price is computed as the weighted average of baseline gasoline and diesel price, where the weights equal the respective fuel’s share of baseline total road fuel consumption;\nthe policy road fuel price is computed as the weighted average of policy gasoline and diesel price, where the weights equal the respective fuel’s share of policy total road fuel consumption;\nthe price change is defined as the ratio of the policy road fuel price over the baseline road fuel price.\n\nWe obtain the policy forecast \\(Y_{t}^{\\text{policy}}\\) by weighting the price change by the elasticity wrt fuel price \\(\\eta_{p}\\).\n\\[Y_{t}^{\\text{policy}} = \\left( \\frac{p^{\\text{policy}}}{p^{\\text{baseline}}} \\right)^{\\eta_{p}}Y_{t}^{\\text{baseline}} \\tag{7.9}\\]\nwhere \\(p^{\\text{baseline}}\\) is the baseline road fuel price and \\(p^{\\text{policy}}\\) is the policy road fuel price.\n\n\n7.7.4 Dashboard graphics\nFor VKT and the three outcomes of interest, we establish similar graphics in the CPAT dashboard.\nFor each variable, there is a line graph representing the time series of the baseline forecast \\(Y_{t}^{\\text{baseline}}\\) and the policy forecast \\(Y_{t}^{\\text{policy}}\\). An example is given in Figure Figure 7.11.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.11: Urban congestion (additional time needed because of congestion, for US$50 per tCO2e in 2030), Mexico\n\n\nSource: Tomtom, own computations.\nWe then plot a bar chart of the difference between the two lines of Figure Figure 7.11, representing only the change induced by the policy. An example is given in Figure 7.12.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.12: Averted deaths from road accidents (for US$50 per tCO2e in 2030), India\n\n\nSource: WRS, OECD, UNECE, own computations.\nFinally, we provide some general evidence of the effect of fuel prices on accident and congestion with a scatter graph. For this scatter graph, we combine cross-sectional country-level information for a given year with year-level information of all available years for the country for which the policy introduction is studied. We also add a linear trendline, which captures the negative correlation between fuel prices and our outcomes. An example is given in Figure 7.13.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.13: Historical relationship between fuel prices and road accident fatalities, global and Germany\n\n\nSource: WRS, Enerdata, EIU, IEA, own computations.\n\n\n7.7.5 Externality cost per liter of motor fuel\nThis section explains how CPAT computes the externality cost (per liter of motor fuel) from accidents and congestion. The externality costs are computed as the co-benefits from a carbon tax-induced reduction in motor fuel consumption.\nThe main road transport co-benefits of a carbon tax are a reduction in road accidents (from a reduction in driving, changes in the vehicle fleet, less aggressive driving, etc.) and a reduction in congestion (from a reduction in driving, an increase in car sharing, changes in the vehicle fleet, changes in transport timing decisions, etc.).\nWithin CPAT, the magnitude of these co-benefits is computed using empirical elasticities from a large historical dataset using econometric panel methods. Given the multitude of channels involved in the final result, the effect on accidents/congestion is not directly proportional to the change in vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) or the change in fuel consumption. For more details on the data and estimation procedure, please refer to the Technical Appendix to the CPAT Road Transport Module.\nThe externality cost is computed as follows:\n\nCompute baseline forecast of accidents/congestion without policy;\n\nBaseline forecasts take into account historical growth rates, adjusted for forecasted GDP and population growth.\n\nCompute policy forecast of accidents/congestion with carbon tax of users choice;\n\nPolicy forecasts are the baseline forecast adjusted for the fuel price change using the country-specific elasticity; this country-specific elasticity is empirically estimated and measures overall (i.e. across channels) which fuel prices affect accidents/congestion.\n\nCompute for policy and baseline scenarios the monetary value of accidents (multiplying fatalities by value of statistical life) and congestion (multiplying time lost in traffic times value of travel time);\nCompute the change in value of accidents/congestion;\nDivide change in value by change in motor fuel consumption from CPAT Mitigation Module.\n\nThe externality cost estimate varies each year. For simplicity, only one year is shown as an example in the CPAT Dashboard. As an example Figure 7.14 shows the graph for Colombia.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.14: Externality cost per liter of motor fuel in 2024, Colombia\n\n\nSource: Tomtom, WRS, UNECE, OECD, IMF, own computations.\nNote that the TomTom Traffic Index is defined on the city-level. Therefore, the congestion externality shown in CPAT applies only the urban part of transport. To our knowledge, there is no database measuring congestion levels on the national level. Rural transport is assumed to be free of congestion, i.e. causing zero congestion externality cost."

    "text": "7.8 Caveats\nThe CPAT Road Transport Module choses a reduced-form econometric approach to predict the impact of carbon taxes on road transport externalities. Certain caveats must be kept in mind:\n\nThe quality of the estimates relies on the quality of available data. For certain countries/years, there is no sufficient data to estimate country-specific transport externality elasticities. In these cases, an internationally estimated default value was used. In the Road Transport Module (Transport tab, section B – elasticities), the user can see whether country-specific or default elasticities have been used.\nReduced-form approaches do not explicitly model the mechanisms. A carbon tax impacts transport demand through various channels: more fuel-efficient use of existing vehicles (e.g. speed, carpooling), switch to less carbon-intensive means of transport (e.g. public transport, non-motorized), reduction in the number/length of trips. The CPAT Road Transport Module cannot disentangle these channels, and can thus not attribute changes in outcomes to individual channels. In particular, carbon taxes make the use of private vehicles more expensive and CPAT cannot measure the loss from the value of non-realized trips.\nGeneral equilibrium effects are not included, such as changes in prices or availability of the outside options. One example frequently discussed are electric vehicles (EVs). Currently, CPAT Road Transport Module does not include EVs. However, an extension of the CPAT Road Transport Module is planned in order to include EVs.\nElasticities, such as estimated with the CPAT Road Transport Module’s methodology, predict the reaction of outcomes to small changes in carbon taxes. CPAT Road Transport module does not account for potentially non-linear responses to large policy changes. In particular, large policy changes across the world may induce technology changes and relevant changes in the vehicle fleet.\nA uniform carbon tax would impact not only private vehicles but also lower-emitting transport modes such as buses. An increase in the price of public transit could have a negative impact on people’s ability to reach jobs and essential services thereby contributing to fragmented labor markets and loss of welfare. Since low-income households are more likely to reduce their number of trips (instead of switching means of transport), a carbon tax could reduce their access to economic opportunities and thereby impact inequality. While it is not within the scope of CPAT1.0, understanding the potential impact of carbon pricing on access to employment is important to inform the development of more targeted policies that can offset any such negative distributional effects of a carbon tax on transit accessibility."

    "text": "7.9 Status of upgrades since the last review, changes not implemented and remaining issues\nWe constantly update the dataset used to estimate the parameters behind the CPAT Road Transport Module. So far, CPAT reflects the last complete update using the WRS 2020 edition. A further update using the WRS 2021 edition is in progress.\nAs we are using proprietary data, we had to transform all non-shareable (proprietary) data into a shareable form. For the Road Transport Module, this was mainly achieved by using (near-future) forecast based on historic data forecasts, instead of the historic data itself.\nWe have further added estimates of the externality cost per liter of motor fuel, described in Section 7.7.5.\nWe are still working on two features not yet implemented:\n\nIntegration of electric vehicles (EVs): The introduction of EVs and their necessary charging infrastructure is relatively slow, especially in developing countries. So far, we have struggled to get sufficient data for credible estimations. Nevertheless, we are aware that EVs may fundamentally change the link between traffic (including accidents and congestion) and carbon taxes. We are thus working on a methodology to include EVs and EV-supporting policies into CPAT.\nBetween-module consistency: Currently, the VKT estimates in the CPAT Road Transport Module are not linked to the transport CO2 in the Mitigation Module. In fact, VKT and CO2 may follow distinct paths as technology and driving habits (e.g. number of people in a vehicle) change. Nevertheless, future versions of CPAT will improve the coordination between modules."

Both methodologies yield very similar results in their case. In the data used here, the number of distributed lags to be included seems difficult to establish and the results do not appear very consistent.↩︎\nSee the Stata 15 longitudinal data/panel-data reference manual for more details (Stata Press, 2017).↩︎\nIn our calculations, “recent” has been defined as the country average over the five most recent available years of a given variable.↩︎\nIncluding all country-years results in an overcrowded unreadable graph, but the negative relationship persists.↩︎\nProduced using Stata’s kdensity command.↩︎\nIf several sources are indicated, the order is respected: only missing observations of the first source are completed using the second source, and so forth.↩︎\nAll variables from the WHO Road Safety reports/Global Healh Observatory are only available for 2011 and 2017↩︎"
