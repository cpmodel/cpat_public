<p>The mitigation module lies at the heart of CPAT. It is based on a simplified reduced-form model of fuel consumption, with two alternative power sector models, one of which is a simplified structural technoeconomic power model.</p>
<p>The mitigation module’s goal is to predict energy use, energy prices, emissions, carbon tax revenues, economic costs, and GDP effects for a baseline and a policy scenario (carbon pricing, fuel taxes, energy efficiency policies, renewables subsidies, feebates, etc.), over the time horizon of CPAT (2019-2035).</p>
<p>To this end, the module is built around different inputs, including (1) energy balances and price inputs; (2) external forecasts (baseline international energy prices and macro indicators); (3) parameter inputs (elasticities, fiscal multipliers, etc.); (4) user-specified policy inputs (for example, the level and coverage of a carbon tax, exemptions and exemption phase-outs, and other inputs).</p>
<p>These inputs inform the calculation steps in which: (1) sectoral energy prices, including the effect of pricing policy, are determined; (2) fuel use in the buildings, transport, and industry are estimated; and (3) electricity production costs are calculated to feed the two power models, which then determine generation, investment, etc.</p>
<p>The module’s outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector, greenhouse gas emissions (CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG such as methane), fiscal revenues and GDP effects, price changes, power generation, and power sector investment.

<p>The mitigation module is a simplified reduced-form model of fuel consumption, deriving quantities under a baseline and a policy scenario broadly in line with more complex models (the IEA’s World Energy Model, Enerdata POLES – see 3.8.3 Model comparisons). The mitigation module’s goal is to predict energy use, energy prices, emissions, carbon tax revenues, economic costs, domestic environmental co-benefits, and GDP effects over the time horizon of CPAT (2018-2035) for a wide range of mitigation instruments (carbon pricing, fuel taxes, energy efficiency policies, renewables subsidies, feebates, etc.). The main drivers of the emissions projections are GDP growth (including GDP-per-capita and population), income elasticities, and rates of technological change. Fuel use responses to policies are driven principally by proportional changes in fuel prices caused by projected market dynamics and government policies (including carbon prices).</p>

<p>Figure 3‑1: Overview of the mitigation module</p>
<p>The mitigation module relies on several inputs and provides numerous outputs. The module is at the core of CPAT, as its results feed into other modules.</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Figure 3‑2: Overview of the mitigation module’s inputs and outputs</p>
<p>The general approach to determining baseline fuel consumption and the response to a carbon tax or other policy is a simplified, reduced-form model based on income and price elasticities.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The changes in energy consumption from the base year are driven by energy prices (including the influence of mitigation policy) and real (total) GDP. Real GDP (which is the primary driver of the baseline) adjusts to changes in fiscal policy through multiplier effects (see the Chapter on Multipliers). Exogenous changes to efficiency and the price of renewable energy are also drivers of fuel use and composition.</p>
<p>The mitigation module comprises two power sector models and simple models for industry, transport, and buildings. The two power models, the ‘elasticity-based’ model and the hybrid techno-economic dynamic model (‘engineer model’) of the power sector with explicit capital stock use identical power demand elasticities and separately consider power generation’s costs by type. For ‘off-the-shelf’ usage of CPAT, we recommend an average of the two models. For more tailored work, we recommend using the engineer model.</p>
<p>The elasticity-based model requires only minor tailoring and checking. As a result, it makes no distinction between short-term and long-term behavior. It also fails to distinguish between dispatchable and non-dispatchable generation types. The engineer power model fills this gap by separating investments, retirement, and dispatch decisions. It includes countries’ generation capacities and makes it possible to investigate the radically different power systems compatible with high carbon prices. However, the model still cannot account for inflexibility, off-price policies, and local price variation (e.g., coal). Due to the constraints of Excel, it can only approximate the temporal match between electricity supply and demand.</p>
<p>The module’s outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector (i.e., buildings, transport, and industry). They are estimated based on a fundamental model structure described in an IMF paper.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Energy use responds to energy prices and real GDP. Additional outputs include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG emissions such as leakage methane which represents small amounts of GHG gases), fiscal revenues and GDP effects, economic efficiency costs, price changes, power generation, and power sector investment.</p>
<p>To ensure that the model is correctly fitted, specific calibrations are undertaken for the observed years, i.e.,&nbsp;2019, 2020, and 2021 (and beyond if necessary and if data are available). In particular, due to the unprecedented global economic shock induced by Covid-19 and Ukraine invasion, energy prices may have behaved in an “anomalous” way, leading the model results to deviate from the observed data. This calibration ensures a proper starting trajectory for the model.</p>
<p>The rest of this section is intended to help reviewers navigate the Mitigation documentation by highlighting the tool’s key components, and the main conclusions resulting from the validation analysis of CPAT.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="niche-use-cases-for-cpat"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Niche &amp; Use cases for CPAT</h3>
<p>CPAT requires minimal training to be used effectively. Computer literacy, basic familiarity with Excel, and some understanding of economic and climate concepts. Flexibility is built-in for the more advanced user, to allow for different assumptions than those in the default assumption set and for choosing among various data inputs. Advanced users can also input their own data.</p>
<p>Although CPAT is powerful even on its own, it is still advisable to use it alongside other tools that may have a more granular representation, of say, technological detail, sectors, feedback mechanisms, trade linkages, behavioral responses, etc. CPAT is designed to be light on resource and skill needs, providing a rapid first-cut analysis when one seeks to test various carbon pricing designs.</p>
<p>The carbon tax is the most effective instrument for emissions reduction in CPAT. By default, its coverage spans the whole economy, but the user can also set this to select sectors. The ETS covers the whole economy by default with the option also to select coverage. A key assumption is that the ETS and carbon tax are equivalent in a frictionless market with full auctioning. While the ETS design lets the user select prices (rather than quantities), frictions imply that ETS is not as effective at reducing emissions as a carbon tax. The user can choose the initial carbon tax level, when to commence carbon pricing, the target carbon price, the year that the target level is achieved, and the sectoral coverage of the carbon tax.</p>

<p>The reviewer should be aware of a few critical modeling choices.</p>
<p>First, the user has the option to as well as a carbon price to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Those are shown on the top right of the main policy panel.</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Figure 3‑3: Main Settings Panel</p>
<p>There is the option (<u><strong>default to on</strong></u>) to <strong>convert the carbon price into a GHG tax</strong> across all sectors (including LULUCF, Waste, etc.) See the red dash on the bottom left of the panel above.</p>
<p>The user can default to the Variable Renewable Energy maximum scale-up rate (See red arrow above). The default is ‘Country Specific,’ which gives and adds additional solar generation of 2% of the total power generated each year plus an extra 2% for wind (except for China which has 2.5% for solar and 2.5% for wind). The implications of these maximum scale-up rates are in the second panel below, bottom right.</p>
<p>Investment behavior in state-owned power sectors responds to the carbon tax as a shadow price of carbon for government investment, i.e., we assume state plans respond as well as the private sector.</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Figure 3‑4: Power Setting Panel</p>
<p>Fourth, CPAT, by default, has two ad hoc adjustments: a Covid adjustment for 2021 and 2022 and a coal share adjustment. The engineer power model coal share adjustment is a country-specific value for some countries that adds an intangible cost to coal generation (representing regulations not captured in CPAT plus lack of flexibility relative to natural gas). That adjustment can be turned off in the power setting panel (around row 131). The setting is calibrated to current coal shares and long-term IEA projections.</p>

<p>A calibration exercise is performed for some key variables to prevent the model from deviating from observed data (i.e., for 2019 to 2021) and ensure a proper starting trajectory, particularly in the context of Covid. Against this background, the following adjustments have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall energy use through Covid adjustment in 2020 and 2021</strong>: Due to the unprecedented global economic shock induced by Covid-19, the energy consumption factor makes an ad hoc adjustment to the model and is calibrated using emissions outturn as the overall numeraire in 2020 and 2021.</p></li>
<li><p>Calibration in the engineer power model:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Total electricity generation</strong>: A COVID adjustment factor can be used to calibrate total electricity generation. The latter, estimated by the model, is compared to observed data (IEA, 2020). It is worth mentioning that the default in CPAT does not account for this calibration, but this calibration can be turned on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Share of coal</strong>: The share of coal in electricity generation is calibrated to observed data in 2019 and 2020 (IEA, 2019 and 2020). The calibration uses an additional implicit price for coal – if necessary – to match the observed share of coal.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Emissions</strong>: In 2019, both <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span> energy-related emissions are scaled to UNFCCC inventory emissions, meaning they are multiplied by a factor such that base-year emissions are equal in the model and the inventory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-term storage is based on electrolysers</strong>: Given its interseasonal storage and geographic independence, we focus on the costs of electrolysers for storage. This storage cost is thus assumed as long-term storage and is measured with the interface (i.e., electrolysers) as the numeraire.</p></li>

<h3 data-number="3.1.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="caveats"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.8</span> Caveats</h3>
<p>There are some notable caveats/limitations to CPAT, given its largely reduced form approach and its mid-term (to 2035) horizon. Sections of this document could also complement this section by presenting the upgrades made to CPAT since the last review and outlining desired upgrades, known issues, and valuable analyses not completed.</p>
<section id="policy-modeling" class="level4" data-number="3.1.8.1">
<h4 data-number="3.1.8.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="policy-modeling"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.8.1</span> Policy modeling</h4>
<p>CPAT abstracts from the possibility of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Designing complex policy packages</strong>, including a <strong>combination of instruments</strong> (e.g., ETS, carbon tax, and offsets) and accounting for <strong>mitigation actions</strong> in the baseline scenario (beyond those already captured in recently observed fuel use/price data and known carbon pricing mechanisms). However, policy combinations can be done sequentially — analyze one policy and use this outcome as the new baseline for the next policy, etc. In the same vein, CPAT does not account for <strong>international linkages across countries or emissions leakage</strong>, which prevents explicit analysis of the implications of border carbon adjustments which are receiving increased attention.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Differences in fuel price responsiveness</strong> may vary across countries with the structure of the energy system and regulations on energy prices or emission rates<strong>.</strong> Nonetheless, this latter default can be easily adjusted in individual country analysis. In addition, <strong>feedback from carbon pricing</strong>, like the impact of carbon pricing reform on commodity prices or interest rates which could be feedback to affect emission reductions, cannot be easily designed in an Excel-based tool.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-linear responses to significant policy changes</strong>, such as rapid adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies (deployed in the power and industry sectors) or even direct air capture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upward sloping fuel supply curves and changes in international fuel prices</strong> that might result from simultaneous climate or energy price reform in large countries. CPAT is parameterized to behave like the mid-point of the broader modeling literature. Although many models account for these factors, no big difference is observed, given the relatively flat supply curves for coal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Applying different coverage levels across sector groups</strong>. CPAT allows the user to select the sectors and fuels to be considered for policy implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>For new policies, the coverage is binary, whether they are included or not.</li>
<li>Whenever the user defines exemptions for fuels or sectors and determines a phaseout period for those exemptions, the coverage can be fractional during that period.</li>
<li>For existing policies, instead, the coverage is mostly fractional, and it is currently computed as an average of the fuel demand covered across sector groups or fuel types.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="prices" class="level4" data-number="3.1.8.2">
<h4 data-number="3.1.8.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prices"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.8.2</span> Prices</h4>
<p>When it comes to prices, CPAT does not model:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upward sloping fuel supply curves</strong> <strong>and changes in international fuel prices</strong> that might result from simultaneous climate or energy price reform in large countries—parameter values are, however, chosen such that the results from the model are broadly consistent with those from far more detailed energy models that, to varying degrees, account for these sorts of factors (see Section 3.8.3).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Institutional setup driving prices</strong>. In CPAT, energy demand responds to prices in the private sector, although the institutional setup could, in some markets, prevent prices from determining supply and demand.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="emissions" class="level4" data-number="3.1.8.3">
<h4 data-number="3.1.8.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="emissions"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.8.3</span> Emissions</h4>
<p>The following limitations and constraints exist when computing the emissions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>In the current version of CPAT, international linkages across countries or emissions leakage are not factored in</strong>. This prevents explicit analysis (in the first public version) of the implications of border carbon adjustments which are receiving increased attention.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy related N2O emissions are calibrated on CO2 emissions preventing the independence of one from the other</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of LULUCF CO2 emissions, <strong>a condition to model the sink activity can create an irreversible state of a positive sink</strong> (more absorptions than emissions). Even if the previous year’s emissions (the year before the base year)&nbsp;are negative, there is no possibility of returning to a negative sink.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="energy-use-all-energy-sectors" class="level4" data-number="3.1.8.4">
<h4 data-number="3.1.8.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="energy-use-all-energy-sectors"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.8.4</span> Energy use (all energy sectors)</h4>
<p>A first important caveat, common to all of our approaches, lies in the fact that the <strong>autonomous efficiency improvement and time trend of consumer preferences and technology are treated in the same way</strong>. In other words, it is implicitly assumed that the time trend of consumer preferences and technology is not varying. However, it can be subject to changes over time. For instance, technology can get more or less energy intensive as it changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="power-sector" class="level4" data-number="3.1.8.5">
<h4 data-number="3.1.8.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="power-sector"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.8.5</span> Power sector</h4>
<p>The two different power models in CPAT have different strengths and weaknesses. For ‘off-the-shelf’ use, we recommend using the average of the two models. We recommend the techno-economic (‘engineer’) power model specified with detailed modeling choices and input parameters for more tailored use.</p>
<p>The <strong>elasticity-based power model</strong> is responsive to <em>relative</em> price changes but not absolute prices. It does not explicitly model the capital stock, so it cannot distinguish between short-run capacity factor differences and long run capital stock changes. Thus, changes in generation for fixed capacity stock generation types may be too fast. It may also model unrealistic reductions in generation from renewables if their price were to increase relative to other options. Conversely, changes in generation for dispatchable types may be insufficiently responsive to price. The model could produce outcomes that are not physically realistic.</p>
<p>The <strong>techno-economic ‘engineer’ power</strong> model has the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investment behavior in state-owned power sectors responds to the carbon tax as a shadow price of carbon for government investment,</strong> i.e., we assume state plans respond as well as the private sector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The power maximum retirement rate for coal is set to 80%</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Estimates of national capacity by generation type across time</strong>. Since no such dataset exists globally, CPAT’s current approach relies on its own estimates. Fossil capacity collected from the EIA is scaled using independently estimated shares.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In CPAT, the investment decision is not fully commercial</strong> but assumes a quasi-least cost approach to meeting aggregate energy demand (and power demand).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fiscal expenditures of government investment in power are not accounted for</strong>. Such a feature is not implemented, partly because power investment is typically funded by customers even if financed by the government – so including it would raise consistency issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There could be a better assessment of flexibility</strong> (and ease of implementing VRE) based on the capacity reserve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Losses associated with round-trip efficiency</strong> (i.e., the ratio between the power put in and the energy retrieved from storage) are currently <strong>not accounted for in the current model</strong>. Power storage consumes electricity and saves it to hand it then back to the grid. The higher the round-trip efficiency, the less energy is lost in the storage process.</p></li>

<p>At the time of writing, the base year for CPAT is 2019. The base year plus the next two years (2020 and 2021) are considered the ‘historical price years’ for CPAT. The algorithm for the historical price years and the future price years is different; we use historical price information in the historical price years and a forecast approach for the future price years.</p>
<p>Domestic price information for historical time periods comes from a dataset created by the IMF side of the joint WB-IMF team. We refer to this dataset as the ‘IMF dataset’. Information about this dataset is available from the IMF and is not part of this documentation. The user can supplement these data with specifically-sourced data (‘manual inputs’).</p>
<p>To forecast domestic prices forward, we also use projections of <em>international</em> fuel prices (for example, crude oil prices). These forecasts are created as an average of internationally recognized sources. The default is an average of IMF and WB projections, although other options are available if the user chooses. The user should however make sure that these sources are updated.</p>
<p>While the method used to build the data may change from the ‘historical price years’ to the years where fuel prices are forecasted, the identity to obtain retail prices <span class="math inline">\(p_{\text{cgft}}\)</span> (for a given country <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, sectors grouping <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and fuel type <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, during period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) remains the same: <strong>Retail prices equal the supply costs plus all relevant taxes</strong>. As for latter, the different hierarchies, coverage, exemptions, and types of tax, require additional disaggregations. For instance, value added taxes may be paid on top of other taxes and fees, so it will be convenient to express the retail price identity as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{\text{cgft}} = sp_{\text{cgft}} + \text{va}t_{\text{cgft}} + \text{tx}o_{\text{cgft}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{sp}\)</span> stands for the supply cost (also referred to as the pre-tax price), <span class="math inline">\(\text{vat}\)</span> is the value added tax, and <span class="math inline">\(\text{txo}\)</span> stands for the excise and all other taxes. Furthermore, <span class="math inline">\(\text{txo}\)</span> acts as net additional taxes, as it corresponds to the addition of consumer subsidies <span class="math inline">\(\text{cs}\)</span>, fixed or ad valorem taxes <span class="math inline">\(\text{fao}\)</span>, any existing carbon price <span class="math inline">\(\text{xcp}\)</span>, and any new carbon price <span class="math inline">\(\text{ncp}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{tx}o_{\text{cgft}} = cs_{\text{cgft}} + \text{fa}o_{\text{cgft}} + \text{xc}p_{\text{cgft}} + \text{nc}p_{\text{ocgft}}\)</span></p>
<p>Note that the existing and new carbon prices may result from policies related either to carbon taxation or ETS permit prices, as it will be explained in upcoming sections.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes the process used to build the information for prices and subsidies for the base years and the forecasted period. Additional information on each element can be found in the upcoming sections.</p>

<p>The IMF dataset on prices and subsidies includes data for supply costs, producer subsidies, VAT, excise and other taxes, consumer subsidies, and retail prices by country, sector group and fuel type. This dataset is, hence, at the core of the information for historical prices used in CPAT. Existing policies (carbon taxation or ETS permits) with information both in terms of carbon price levels as well as the fuel and sector coverage, complete the dataset for CPAT’s ‘historical price years’. A brief description of the price components used in CPAT is provided below:</p>
<p><strong>Historical retail price:</strong> Included in the IMF data set. Rounding errors aside, it equals the sum of supply costs, VAT, and excise and other taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Supply cost:</strong> Included in the IMF data set. It is calculated as a weighted average of domestic extraction costs and international prices plus transport costs, where the weights refer to the proportion of the components that are domestically produced or imported.</p>
<p><strong>VAT:</strong> Included in the IMF data set. Computed as VAT collected over total sales (for a given fuel and sector), or as the result of applying a country or sector-specific VAT rate to the sales of a fuel to a sector.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Subsidy:</strong> Included in the IMF data set. Computed as total subsidy over total sales (for a given fuel and sector).</p>
<p><strong>Producer Subsidy:</strong> Included in the IMF data set. Computed as total subsidy over total sales (for a given fuel).</p>
<p><strong>Existing Carbon Price:</strong> Sourced from <em>State and Trends of Carbon Pricing</em>.</p>
<p><strong>New Carbon Price:</strong> User-defined. It is typically zero in the base years.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed ad valorem and other taxes:</strong> Balancing item, computed as a residual: <span class="math inline">\(\text{fao} = \text{txo} - \text{cs} - \text{xcp} - \text{ncp}\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Supply cost</strong> for a fuel type <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in a given country <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and sector grouping <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and during period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, is calculated using a coefficient of supply costs to base years (2017-2019) to the global prices in the same period, multiplied by the respective international fuel price in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(sp_{\text{cgft}} = \frac{sp_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{gp_{f,t_{0}}}*gp_{\text{cft}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(sp_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}\)</span> denotes the average supply costs for country <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in base years <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(gp_{f,t_{0}}\)</span> is the average global fuel price in base years, and <span class="math inline">\(gp_{\text{cft}}\)</span> is the global fuel price based on the chosen international energy price forecast in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. As for the latter, note that information on global prices may be taken from different markets depending on the region or country.</p>
<p>In practice, the supply costs dependence on global prices may not be the same for a country that produces the fuel vs.&nbsp;one that imports it. Moreover, the supply cost can be affected by any existing producer-side subsidies, as well as by simulated policies where these would be phased out. The treatment of these advanced cases is presented in Appendix C - Prices And Taxes Methodology.</p>
<p><strong>VAT payment</strong> equals the previous year’s VAT payment ratio to the supply cost multiplied by the current year’s supply cost:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{va}t_{\text{cgft}} = \frac{\text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\text{cgft}}\)</span></p>
<p>NOTE: 1. Users are given the option to include <span class="math inline">\(\text{txo}\)</span> as part of the VAT base; 2. The residential and transport sectors may instead be computed by applying a nation-wide constant VAT rate to the VAT base (<span class="math inline">\(\text{sp}\)</span>, here).</p>
<p><strong>Consumer-side fossil fuel subsidy:</strong> Based on the fixed part of consumer subsidy per unit of energy, the new value is adapted to account for phasing-out of consumer side subsidies, and the phasing out of price controls, that create implicit subsidies.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(cs_{\text{cgft}} = cs_{cgf0}*\phi_{\text{CS},t} + \left( \text{pc}c_{\text{cf}} - 1 \right)*\left( \text{Δg}p_{\text{ft}}*\phi_{\text{PC},t} \right)\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{\text{CS}}\)</span> is the phase-out factor for consumer-side subsidies, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{\text{PC}}\)</span> is the phase-out factor for price controls, <span class="math inline">\(\text{pc}c_{\text{cf}}\)</span> is the price control coefficient and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Δg}p_{\text{ft}}\)</span> is the difference between current and previous global prices.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed ad valorem and other taxes</strong> are projected based on last year’s information. There are two possible cases:</p>
<p>$o_{} = \left{</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{matrix}
\frac{\text{Σfa}o_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{n_{t_{0}}} &amp; \text{if\ fixed} \\
&amp; \\
\frac{\text{fa}o_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\text{cgf},t} &amp; \text{if\ ad\ valorem} \\
\end{matrix}\]</span>
<p>.$</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{Σfa}o_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{n_{t_{0}}}\)</span> represents the average value of <span class="math inline">\(\text{fao}\)</span> during the base year.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Carbon Price:</strong> Resulting for already implemented carbon taxes or ETS permits and their prices, it is assumed that these policies are complemented by any new measure selected by the user. Thus, the price is assumed to be equal to the latest available observation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{xc}p_{\text{cgft}} = \text{xc}p_{\text{cgf},t - 1} = \text{xc}t_{\text{cgf},t - 1}*\left( 1 + \delta_{\text{CT}} \right) + \text{xets}p_{\text{cgf},t - 1}*\left( 1 + \delta_{\text{ETS}} \right)\)</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(\text{xc}t_{\text{cgf},t - 1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{xets}p_{\text{cgf},t - 1}\)</span> representing the existing carbon taxes and ETS permit prices per energy unit, respectively. As part of the advanced options, CPAT allows the user to select a fix growth rate for each – the existing carbon tax and the existing ETS permit price. This is captured by the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> in both cases.</p>
<p><strong>New Carbon Price:</strong> It accounts for the price resulting from the implementation of new policies (carbon taxation or ETS permit prices). It can be decomposed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{nc}p_{\text{cgft}} = \text{nc}t_{\text{cgft}} + \text{nets}p_{\text{cgft}} = \text{NC}T_{\text{ct}}*ef_{\text{cgf}}*\varphi_{\text{NCT},\text{cgft}} + \text{NETS}P_{\text{ct}}*ef_{\text{cgf}}*\varphi_{\text{NETS},\text{cgft}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{nc}t_{\text{cgft}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{nets}p_{\text{cgft}}\)</span> stand for the new carbon tax per energy unit and the new ETS price per energy unit, respectively. In both cases, the value per energy unit is obtained based on the national price per ton of <span class="math inline">\(CO2\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\text{NC}T_{\text{ct}}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\text{NETS}P_{\text{ct}}\)</span>), and scaling it by the country-sector-fuel specific emission factors, <span class="math inline">\(ef_{\text{cgf}}\)</span>, and the sector-fuel coverage for the new policies within the country in question (<span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{\text{NCT},\text{cgft}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{\text{NETS},\text{cgft}}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Among the options available, the user can select the sector or fuel that will be exempted from the policy implemented. This is already considered in the sector-fuel coverage <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>. Moreover, such exemptions can be phased out according to user-defined parameters.</p>
<p>Note that both the existing and the new ETS permit prices per ton of CO2, <span class="math inline">\(\text{XETS}P_{c,t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{NETS}P_{c,t}\)</span> respectively, correspond to the <strong>adjusted</strong> values after the penalization. In other words, to the value comparable to the level of a carbon tax. For more information on this, refer to Appendix C - Prices And Taxes Methodology.</p>
<p><strong>Excise and other taxes</strong> are computed as the sum of its forecasted components.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{tx}o_{\text{cgf},t} = cs_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{fa}o_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{xc}p_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{nc}p_{\text{cgf},t}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Retail price</strong> for fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in years <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the sum of the supply price, VAT, and excise and other taxes.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{o,\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{tx}o_{\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t} + \left( cs_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{fa}o_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{xc}p_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{nc}p_{\text{cgf},t} \right)\)</span></p>
<p>It should be noted that, while this relationship is true for all cases, for the baseline scenario the new carbon price component, included in <span class="math inline">\(\text{txo}\)</span>, is null.</p>

<p>The fuel use for fuel type <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and sector <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> can be related to the fuel use in the previous year as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{F_{\text{ocsf},t}}{F_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} = \left( \frac{1}{1 + \alpha_{\text{sf}}} \right)^{1 + \epsilon_{U,c\text{sf}}}\Psi_{\text{ct}}\left( \frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{Y,\text{csf}}}\left( \frac{p_{\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{U,\text{csf}}}\left( \frac{p_{\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{F,\text{csf}}\left( 1 + \epsilon_{U,\text{csf}} \right)}\)</span></p>
<p>where the main components of the equation are <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, the fuel usage in ktoe, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, the total real GDP, the prices <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> as presented in Section 3.2, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the autonomous annual energy efficiency improvement and, <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>, a Covid adjustment factor to energy demand (see Section 3.3.4.4).

<p><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{Y}\)</span> denotes the forward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel demand for fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. It thus translates a 1% increase in total real GDP into a fuel demand increase. CPAT does not distinguish between the elasticity for real-GDP-per-capita and the elasticity for population.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{U}\)</span>, is the elasticity of usage of energy products and services (i.e.&nbsp;for a 1% increase in prices, how much will total usage be affected in the same year).</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{F}\)</span> denotes the efficiency price elasticity.</p>
<p>For more information on the elasticities and the autonomous annual energy efficiency improvement, see Section 3.3.5. The latter is set to 0.5% or 1%, depending on the sector.</p>
<p>The terms of the energy use equation represent:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>GDP effect</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\left( \frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{Y,\text{csf}}}\)</span></li>
<li>A <strong>price effect on usage</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\left( \frac{p_{\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{U,\text{csf}}}\)</span></li>
<li>A <strong>price effect on energy efficiency</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(\left( \frac{p_{\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{F,\text{csf}}\left( 1 + \epsilon_{U,\text{csf}} \right)}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Both autonomous and price-driven efficiency components are subject to rebound effects by raising to the power of <span class="math inline">\(\left( 1 + \epsilon_{U} \right)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{U}\)</span> is negative.</p>
<p>Note that the term effect on energy efficiency is affected by the shadow price<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> in case non-pricing policy types are implemented, that is feebates and power feebates, energy efficiency regulations, vehicle fuel economy, residential and industrial efficiency regulations. In the equation, the shadow price only affects the efficiency margin and not the price effect since, for instance, an energy efficiency regulation does not aim to increase prices but increases the efficiency.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we assume that all the effects take place over the course of one year. In reality, some effects will take time, but CPAT abstracts from these effects. CPAT is more suited to anticipated and progressively phased policies over the medium term.</p>
<p>Energy use is aggregated into five main sector groupings: Transport, Buildings, Industry, Other Energy Use and Electricity demand.</p>

<p>If this option is turned on, a percent change of the most used cooking fuel (i.e., natural gas, LPG or kerosene) is transferred to biomass. In other words, the relative price change in the most used cooking fuel results in a percentage change in its consumption; this variation change is substituted by biomass. The latter is composed of the substitution elasticity between the most cooking fuel used and biomass (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\text{bio},f}\)</span>), but also accounts for the relative efficiency between the fuels considered, that is only natural gas, LPG and kerosene (<span class="math inline">\(f = \text{nga},\text{lpg\ and\ ker}\)</span>) and biomass (<span class="math inline">\(\text{Ef}f_{f}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ef}f_{\text{bio}}\)</span>, respectively):</p>

<p>The proportion of the natural gas transferred to biomass is thus dependent on the relative efficiency of representative stoves that are used. Therefore, for a 10% price change in, for instance, natural gas, 0.9% of natural gas consumption is shifted to biomass.</p>

<p>In CPAT we transform balances into final energy consumption (buildings, industry, transport, other), power sector (part of energy transformation in balances) and fuel transformation. The fuel transformation sector (FTR) is determined as <strong>the difference between primary and final energy consumption, subtracting Fuel Transformation in the power sector</strong>. This residual is treated as an additional industrial sector called fuel transformation.</p>
<p>In addition, all oil products and natural gas are aggregated to avoid dealing with negative fuel consumption.

<p>Income elasticities relate to general energy demand (electricity, transport, industry, services, residential and other).</p>
<p>Income elasticities of energy demand are selected based on a broad literature review, simplified, adjusted for development levels, and sense-checked to a large dataset of income elasticities and outputs of other models. There are 32 ‘base’ income elasticates in CPAT covering eight energy sources (coal; natural gas; gasoline; diesel; other oil products like LPG and kerosene; biomass; small-scale renewables like solar PV; and electricity) and four sectors (transport including road, rail, aviation and shipping; residential; heavy industries; and public and private services).</p>
<p>These are then sense-checked against a database of income elasticities collected by the authors, which covers over 250 studies 2,000 observations of income elasticities across countries. Next, these are each adjusted for income per capita of the country considered in each projection period (‘adjusted income elasticities’) to reflect the broad finding that income elasticities decline with development. Lastly, the elasticities are checked once more through model intercomparison: comparing the baseline projections from those of many other global, regional, and country-specific models. The process is described further below.</p>

<p>Base income elasticities for sectors are selected based on Burke and Csereklyei (2016), which covers 132 countries from 1960-2010. Fuel-specific elasticities within sectors are then selected based on a literature review such that the weighted global average income elasticity across fuels is within one standard deviation of those found for sectors (left panel of Figure 3-55). Broadly, energy demand grows more quickly in services, industry, transport, and other sector than it does in the residential or agricultural sectors.</p>

<p>It is then further assumed that income elasticities have a reverse-U shape with respect to income levels. This relationship has been found by numerous studies (Gertler et al.&nbsp;2016; Zhu et al.&nbsp;2018; Liddle and Huntington 2020; Caron and Fally 2022). This non-homothetic relationship between incomes and energy could be reflective of the rapid rise in ownership of key energy consuming assets like refrigerators, air conditioners, and vehicles whose ownership tends to binary in nature (e.g.&nbsp;households purchase one fridge but not additional fridges as they become wealthier; Gertler et al.&nbsp;2016). It could also reflect the Environmental Kuznets effect (as incomes increase economies reduce their environmental destruction by, for example, consuming fewer fossil fuels) (Saqib and Benhmad 2021) or ‘dematerialization’ (richer countries tend to need fewer materials for marginal production and hence become more energy efficient).</p>
<p>The relationship between per capita incomes and energy demand is derived from Gertler and others (2016) based on data cross-country analysis 1985-2010. This is then adjusted upwards such that the inferred global average income elasticity from this shape equals that found by Burke and Csereklyei (0.74, 2016) over the same time period (1960-2010). This adjustment is then applied to each base income elasticity’s base for each country over the projection period (varying with each year). The impact for selected fuel-sector pairs is shown in left panel below for per capita GDP and in the right panel for log GDP. Income elasticities jump up as countries graduate from being lower-income to a peak around lower-middle income status (at around $3,000 per capita) and then asymptotically decline until reaching the developed country maximum (at around $22,000 per capita).</p>

<p>Lastly, the results of these income elasticities on baseline energy consumption and emissions are then sense checked through a model inter-comparison. Overall, they allow for initially rapid accelerations in energy demand in developing countries (as households purchase energy-consuming goods like fridges, air conditioning units and cars) as well as broader structural change as countries increase the share of services in GDP and energy consumption.</p>

<p>Own-price elasticities of energy demand are parametrized using a similar approach to income elasticities. A major meta-study to estimate elasticities for fuels, which are then simplified and calibrated to allow for sectoral coverage, sense- and then finally sense checked to a large in-house dataset through model-intercomparison. These steps are described in turn.</p>
<p>Price elasticities in CPAT separated into two broad margins (see below). CPAT contains two types of price elasticities to distinguish between behavioral responses: the direct reduction in demand from reduced intensity of use from existing capital-consuming goods like vehicles (‘intensive margin’) and changes in the composition and scale of those goods (‘efficiency and extensive margin’). The two effects combined less the rebound effect (described later) correspond to the total price elasticity of demand, which is parametrized to the empirical literature<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Table 3‑1 Price elasticities of energy demand in CPAT – Source: IMF staff using various sources. Tables show price elasticities used for developed countries. For developing countries, extensive margin elasticities are uniformly increased (in absolute terms) by 0.1.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><img src="03/media/image12.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Figure 57: Price elasticities of energy demand in CPAT</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The initial source for price elasticities is a meta-study by Labandeira and others (2017). This includes about 2,000 empirically estimated elasticities from 430 studies with broad global coverage of countries, seven fuels, and four sectors (refer to Table A for descriptive statistics). ‘Target’ estimates of elasticities for fuels and sectors are estimated, assuming that the base is the transport sector, plus deviations for the residential, industrial and services sectors (Table B)<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. For any statistically insignificant values for fuels within sectoral regressions (natural gas in residential, for example), it is assumed that the difference between sectoral and base elasticities equal that sectors’ general elasticities multiplied by a scalar for all energy sources.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is evidence that price elasticities are slightly higher for developing countries (about 10%; Labandeira, Labeaga, and López-Otero 2017). Price elasticities are therefore adjusted slightly upwards for developing countries (on the extensive margin) such that they are a similar magnitude higher than for developed countries.</p>
<p>Simple price elasticities (rounded to 1 decimal point) on both the intensive and extensive margin are then calibrated to those targets. As shown in Table C, when weighting for developed and developing countries’ emissions, elasticities in CPAT are very similar (within 10%) to these target elasticities.</p>

<p>These, price elasticities are sense checked both against a large database of price elasticities (covering around 250 studies and 2,500 price elasticities), as well as through model intercomparison of CPAT results compared with those of other models. Both the baseline emissions projections and price responsiveness of emissions is broadly in line with that of other models, while median price elasticities are not significantly different for fuel-sector pairs collected across countries (though there is variation).</p>
<p>Lastly, all elasticities are long-term elasticities.</p>

<p>When prices change, energy consumers also shift to more efficient energy-consuming goods. Marginal costs of fuel consumption are lower for more efficient goods (e.g.&nbsp;each km travelled is cheaper for a vehicle with higher fuel economy), hence there is a corresponding increase in demand for those same fuels (‘direct rebound effect’). As marginal costs of fuel consumption decline, consumers also increase the intensity of consumption of these capital goods (e.g.&nbsp;travel more miles in vehicles).</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image13.png" class="img-fluid"><em>Table</em> <em>3‑3: Implied direct rebound effects from prices (endogenous efficiency improvements increasing demand for energy)</em></p>
<p>The energy use equation outlined in Section 3.3 allows rebound effects, <span class="math inline">\(\left( 1 + \epsilon_{U} \right),\)</span> to be captured and compared to econometric estimates of rebound. Broadly, these align with the empirical literature. More specifically, the rebound effect is defined as the product of the energy efficiency elasticity and the usage elasticity, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{F}*\epsilon_{U}\)</span>, as follows in the term affecting prices change:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\left( \frac{P_{t}}{P_{t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{F} + \epsilon_{U} + \epsilon_{F}*\epsilon_{U}}\)</span></p>
<p>With <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{F} = \epsilon_{U} = - 0.3\)</span>, the rebound effect represents 15.5% (i.e.&nbsp;the rebound effect reduces the total price elasticity by 15.5%). This result is lower, but seems more reasonable, than the estimates in a meta-analysis of 74 studies in Dimitropoulos and others (26-29% rebound effect, 2018).</p>
<p>The estimated leakage effects in residential natural gas (31%) are similar to those found in studies (20% to 30%, Haas and Biermayr 2000).</p>

<p>CPAT contains three substitution or cross-price elasticities to account for the risk that households that face increases in costs for residential heating and cooking fuels shift to informal fuels like biomass. This ‘leakage’ effect can have a negative impact on household air pollution and hence welfare, which is calculated by CPAT’s air pollution module. These cross-price elasticities (biomass with respect to LPG and kerosene, as well gasoline with respect to diesel) are parameterized to the same broad literature review.</p>

</div>
<p>It should be noted that – as with efficiency induced endogenously by price changes – exogenous efficiency improvements reduce marginal costs of energy consumption, hence there is some rebound effect that partly offsets the reduction in demand from improved efficiency. A large literature exists that examines the rebound effect from efficiency improvements, with estimates varying significantly, from 0 to 300% (Saunders et al.&nbsp;2021). In CPAT, this rebound from exogenous efficiency improvements depends on the fuel-sector pair and its corresponding intensive margin and efficiency, but broadly it is between 20% to 60% across fuels and sectors.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="power-sector-models-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Power sector models</h2>
<p>The mitigation module has two models that can be used for the electricity sector: the elasticity-based model and the techno-economic (‘engineer’) model. The user can choose to use the elasticity, engineer model, or a simple average of the two models. We recommend the ‘average’ model for ‘off-the-shelf’ use of CPAT and the engineer model for more tailored usages and for non-marginal changes (like a high CO2 tax policy). Before presenting the two models, it is essential to note that by default, prices and generation costs are applied to both the techno-economic (‘engineer)’ and the elasticity-based power models. The main differences are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The ‘elasticity-based’ model</strong> uses marginal increases in fuel prices and price elasticities to determine the shares of each generation type. It is simple, transparently parameterized, easily explainable, and easily deployable in an Excel spreadsheet model used in previous versions of CPAT and IMF tools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The ‘engineer model’</strong> explicitly models the capacity of different generation types, with capacity<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> expanding to meet desired power demand. Flexible capacity (gas and coal) is allocated according to marginal price, with a sigmoidal function of relative price. Investment is also a function of levelized cost, with a system penalty for the cost of integrating high levels of renewable penetration. Transmission losses are modeled as a fixed quantity of total generation. The model allows modeling decisions changing the stock of assets in the power sector (investment and retirement) and decisions changing the use of assets for power generation (dispatch). In addition, the model allows the user to define a constraint on Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) scale up rate. The rates reflect a ‘linear’ type constraint. It constrains generation in VRE additions to be a certain percentage of total generation (in gross additions, not net of retirements). The model is consistent with countries’ generation capacities and makes it possible to investigate the radically different power systems consistent with high carbon prices, while the empirical ‘elasticity-based’ model is valid only for more marginal changes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In what follows, Section 3.4.1 defines power prices and generation costs, Section 3.4.2 describes the techno-economic model, and Section 3.4.3 the elasticity-based model. Finally, Section 3.4.4 presents the parameter choices of the power models.</p>

<p>This section describes the determination of generation costs and power prices in CPAT. These prices and generation costs are applied to the techno-economic (‘engineer)’ and the elasticity-based power models. However, in the latter case, the user has an alternative option to use a simpler set of prices based on the original IMF board paper, which are not covered here.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.4.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-3"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1.1</span> Overview</h4>
<p>Power generation costs have the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variable (per kWh) operations and maintenance costs;</li>
<li>Fixed (per MW) operations and maintenance costs;</li>
<li>Decommissioning and waste disposal costs;</li>
<li>Fuel cost before the introduction of the carbon pricing policy;</li>
<li>Existing or new renewables subsidies;</li>
<li>Existing or new carbon price or other policy (feebate, excise duty on electricity); and</li>
<li>Systems cost of integration, modeled as short+long-term storage costs as a function of variable renewable energy (VRE; meaning wind+solar+other renewables, but not including hydro or biomass) share.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we impose an implicit price of coal relative to gas, reflecting unobserved environmental regulations on coal and the superior flexibility of gas. These aspects are not fully captured in a model as simple as this. We calibrate this price on observed coal shares and future (IEA) projections (see Section 3.4.2.4).</p>
<p>End-user (industrial and residential) power prices additionally have the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimated transmission and distribution costs (different for industry and residential);</li>
<li>Net historical subsidy or tax (estimated either via a price gap or via independent data if provided by the user);</li>
<li>Any correction for under- or over-estimated transmission and distribution costs (exists only if we have concrete subsidy data);</li>
<li>New carbon tax as imposed on the generation types and passed on to the end user; and</li>
<li>Any electricity excise or rebate of the carbon price (Feebates/Output-based-rebating).</li>

<p>We use four different power generation cost/price concepts in CPAT:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Variable Costs</strong>: For dispatch decisions the current variable costs are used (fuel and variable operations and maintenance).</li>
<li><strong>Levelized Cost of Investment</strong>: For forward looking (investment) decisions, a levelized and forward-looking cost approach adding all cost components is used. For example, one part is <em>forward-looking expectations</em> of future fuel and carbon costs.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-recovery generation cost</strong>: For estimating the total running cost of the power system, a cost-recovery generation cost is estimated. This includes current variable cost, running amortization of capital costs, plus average interest costs (and other components too). The cost-recovery generation cost by generation type is averaged and then transmission and distribution costs added to produce an overall estimate cost of generating and distributing electricity.</li>
<li><strong>End user power prices</strong> (residential and industrial): these are based on observed prices with an adjustment for changes due to cost changes or carbon pricing. The user can decide what proportion of changes to overall generation cost are passed on. The user can also choose to phase out estimated electricity subsidy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Variable costs are used in the dispatch decision directly between gas and coal.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Current variable costs are defined as the sum of the following cost components:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(vc_{\text{ocft}} = \text{vo}p_{\text{ocft}} + fc_{\text{ocft}} + ip_{\text{cft}} = \text{vo}p_{\text{ocft}} + \frac{p_{\text{ocft}}}{\nu_{\text{cf}}} + ip_{\text{cft}}\)</span></p>

<ul>
<li>LCOEs by generation type are estimated as a forward-looking (discounted cashflow) approach.</li>
<li>Note these is different from the cost-recovery prices above as the cost-recovery approach uses an amortization of capital costs and running interest costs rather than discounting.</li>
<li>Fuel and carbon costs in these LCOEs are forward-looking, meaning they are the discounted value of future cashflows assuming full confidence in the proposed policy and full foresight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Forward-looking generation costs are defined using a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) methodology, which relies on discounting at the appropriate discount rate. Levelized cost enables the comparison of different energy technologies with different characteristics (operating lifetime, capacity factor, construction cost, and time) on an equivalent basis. To the levelized cost, we add system integration costs. The levelized cost can be defined, in general, as the discounted sum of costs divided by the discounted sum of electricity produced. Let’s assume that a generation technology produces power for <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> years, and we start counting at year zero (so there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> payments, with the first being <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span> and last being <span class="math inline">\(t = N - 1\)</span>. We separate the components <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> (capital cost) of the levelized costs, which can be treated equivalently. For each component <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> of the levelized cost:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{LCO}E_{q} = \frac{PV_{q}}{\text{dem}} = \frac{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{q,t}e^{- \text{rt}}}{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \text{rt}}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(PV_{q}\)</span> is the present value of costs, <span class="math inline">\(\text{dem}\)</span> is the discounted power produced, <span class="math inline">\(g_{t}\)</span> is the power produced at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_{q,t}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> component of costs at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, breaking down into the following components:</p>
<p>The full investment cost contains the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital expenditure</li>
<li>Decommissioning (all generation types) and waste disposal cost (nuclear only)</li>
<li>Variable OpEx</li>
<li>Fixed OpEx</li>
<li>Fuel Cost Before Carbon Price</li>
<li>Marginal system cost of storage (see next section)</li>
<li>Carbon Price</li>
<li>Implicit cost of coal</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these components is calculated using the levelized cost formula above. Almost all components are either fixed or increasing/decreasing at a fixed rate. In that case we can use a geometric series approximation. See the appendices for a derivation.</p>
<p>The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is by default income-dependent:</p>

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(PV_{q}\)</span> is the present value of costs, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the discounted power produced, <span class="math inline">\(g_{t}\)</span> is the power produced at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_{q,t}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> component of costs at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, breaking down into various components described in the above section.</p>

<ul>
<li>Generation costs are modeled by component (CapEx, OpEx, Fuel costs etc). These are ‘cost recovery prices’ assuming amortization of CapEx, interest costs and so on.</li>
<li>Weighted average generation costs are then augmented by global assumptions on transmission costs, to give estimated cost recovery price.</li>
<li>Then the cost recovery price is compared to observed prices and the difference attributed to being a tax or subsidy (if no independent subsidy data is available) or an under/overestimated cost if independent (user entered) subsidy-data is available.</li>
<li>For cost recovery, a weighted average CapEx of the capital stock is needed. For most generation types, the CapEx per MW is constant, but for renewable energies it declines rapidly so the weighted average invested amount per MW is estimated by taking a weighted average of the current running total with the cost of new additions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current generation cost before tax, <span class="math inline">\(\text{gn}c_{B,\text{cft}}\)</span>, is thus composed of both variable and fixed costs:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{gn}c_{B,\text{cft}} = vc_{B,\text{cft}} + \text{fi}x_{\text{cft}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{vc}\)</span> denotes current variable costs (defined in an earlier section) and <span class="math inline">\(\text{fix}\)</span> denotes amortized fixed costs.</p>
<p>Amortized fixed cost is the sum of the following elements:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{fi}x_{B,\text{cft}} = \text{ac}c_{\text{cft}} + \text{in}t_{\text{cft}} + \text{de}c_{\text{cft}} + \text{st}o_{\text{cft}} + \text{op}f_{\text{cft}}\)</span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{acc}\)</span> is the yearly amortization of capital costs per kWh produced: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}^{\text{av}}}{\text{cf}*365*24*\text{li}f_{f}}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\text{ca}x^{\text{av}}\)</span> the weighted average CapEx, <span class="math inline">\(\text{cf}\)</span> the assumed capacity factor and <span class="math inline">\(\text{lif}\)</span> the lifetime for each fuel. The weighted average CapEx is defined as: <span class="math inline">\(\text{ca}x_{\text{cf},t - 1}^{\text{av}}*\left( 1 - \Phi_{\text{inv}} \right) + \text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}*\Phi_{\text{inv}}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}\)</span> the CapEx and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\text{inv}}\)</span> the new investment expressed as a proportion of total existing capacity less retirements. It is worth noting that the base year, <span class="math inline">\(t_{0}\)</span>, corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}\)</span>. Over time, the CapEx is not varying, except for renewables (for more information see Section 3.4.4.4).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{int}\)</span> is the interest costs per kWh produced, assuming a straight-line amortization of CapEx: <span class="math inline">\(0.5*\frac{\text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}^{\text{av}}*\text{wac}c_{\text{cf}}}{cf_{\text{cf}}*365*24}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\text{wacc}\)</span> is the WACC. The WACC can be adjusted according to different settings and both under a baseline and policy scenarios.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>End-user prices are taken to be equal to current prices plus any change in underlying generation cost.</li>
<li><em>Observed</em> power prices are used as the basis of the demand model.</li>
<li><em>Changes</em> in generation costs (including those caused by carbon prices and any due to the phase-out of aforementioned subsidies) are assumed to be passed on to consumers (the proportion of pass-on defaults to 100% but can be altered.). If the parameter setting price controls is set to not one (could be 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) then all price changes (from technology changes or carbon price) are diminished in the same proportion.</li>
</ul>
<p>To estimate power prices (i.e.&nbsp;before the policy tax is introduced), the weighted current generation cost is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{gn}c_{B,\text{ct}}^{\text{av}} = \sum_{f}^{}gns_{B,\text{cft}}*\text{gn}c_{B,\text{cft}}\)</span></p>
<p>For each country, the weighted average of generation cost <span class="math inline">\(\text{gn}c_{B,c}^{\text{av}}\)</span> is calculated according to generation shares <span class="math inline">\(\text{gn}s_{B,\text{cft}}\)</span> of each fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and their respective current generation cost <span class="math inline">\(\text{gn}c_{B,\text{cf}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the engineer model, power prices are processed specifically in the residential and non-residential sector (i.e.&nbsp;industrial sector). The supply price in the technoeconomic model <span class="math inline">\(sp_{B,\text{cg}}^{T}\)</span> (where the index <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> holds for technoeconomic model) is determined in the residential and industrial sectors (<span class="math inline">\(g = \text{Residential},\text{Industrial}\)</span>) via a fixed positive increment corresponding to transmission cost (<span class="math inline">\(\text{tmc}\)</span>) to the weighted average generation cost such as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(sp_{B,\text{cg}}^{T} = \text{gn}c_{B,\text{ct}}^{\text{av}} + \text{tmc}\)</span></p>
<p>An allowance of $15/MWh and $40/MWh was added to account for transmission and distribution costs for industrial and residential uses, respectively<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A markup <span class="math inline">\(\text{mu}\)</span> is then calculated specifically for residential and industrial electricity prices to equalize the starting year price (i.e.&nbsp;historical retail prices in the electricity sector, <span class="math inline">\(\text{hr}p_{\text{cg}}\)</span>), as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(mu_{B,\text{cgt}}^{T} = \text{gn}c_{B,\text{ct}}^{\text{av}} + \text{tmc} - \text{hr}p_{\text{cg}}.\)</span></p>
<p>It is worth noting that when the markup is negative (i.e.&nbsp;retail prices are lower than modeled supply prices), the model captures a subsidy.</p>
<p>Carbon taxes are applied at the fuel-input stage to each generation. However, for the purposes of the overall generation cost, those costs are excluded as part of the generation cost average and averaged, and added on, separately. This is for the reason that doing this way allows us to calculate easily a needed rebate when rebating is employed.</p>
<p>The final residential and industrial end user power price in the technoeconomic power model, <span class="math inline">\(p_{P,\text{cg}}^{T}\)</span>, is calculated as follows when a carbon price, <span class="math inline">\(\text{nc}p_{\text{cg}}\)</span>, power excise, <span class="math inline">\(\text{pe}x_{P,\text{cgt}}\)</span>, a rebate, <span class="math inline">\(\text{re}b_{\text{cg}}\)</span>, are introduced:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{P,\text{cgt}}^{T} = \text{gn}c_{B,\text{ct}}^{\text{av}} + \text{nc}p_{\text{cgt}} - \text{re}b_{P,\text{cgt}} + \text{pe}x_{P,\text{cgt}} + \text{tmc} + mu_{B,\text{cgt}}^{T}\)</span></p>
<p>At this stage two end-user power price settings are included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Output Based Rebating: the total carbon price is added to the generation types and then subtracted from overall power prices so that the overall policy is revenue-neutral.</li>
<li>Electricity Excise: a per-kwh tax is <em>added</em> at the end-user stage</li>
</ul>

<p>Electricity is widely acknowledged to be critical to ‘deep decarbonization’ scenarios, in the sense that alternatives such as renewables primarily generate electricity instead of solid, liquid, or gaseous energy vectors. Deep decarbonization involves decarbonizing the existing power sector and electrifying sectors that currently use fossil fuels directly. Electrification will also involve expanding the power sector to accommodate the increased power demand from this shift in energy vector. Such a structural model is important for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marginal versus radical</strong>. Elasticity-based models are arguably best suited to price-based demand-side effects of marginal increases in fuel prices. They are less well suited to the non-marginal changes required for deep-decarbonization Paris-compliant scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Within bounds of equipment</strong>. Power systems involve two significant sets of decisions: decisions that change the stock of power generation assets (investment and retirement) and decisions that change the use of those assets for electricity generation (dispatch). Without determining the capital stock, it is unclear that a particular choice of generation is consistent with the actual generation capacities of a specific country. An elasticity-based approach can produce non-physically realistic results (i.e., power dispatched that requires implicit investment rates faster than what is realistic).</li>
<li><strong>Responsiveness to absolute levels of renewable costs</strong>. Elasticity-based models can be unresponsive to actual levels of costs since it is based principally on the changes in cost.</li>
<li><strong>Using accurate, referenced generation cost data</strong>. The elasticity-based model used data that was at times not clearly referenced and not recently updated. For example, the percentage of non-fuel costs in total coal generation costs seems inconsistent between the spreadsheet and the published IMF paper. Neither are directly referenced against currently published costs.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables costs are rapidly changing</strong>, and it is helpful to model this explicitly.</li>
<li><strong>The model should include, and the outcomes depend on, carbon price-dependent switching carbon prices for generation and investment</strong>. It’s helpful to know the ‘switching cost’ (for example, between coal and gas) in terms of the dispatch decision and the investment decision as a valuable marker of required carbon taxes to begin decarbonization.</li>
<li><strong>Modeling the new reality</strong>. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data, newly built renewables have already achieved cost-parity with newly built fossil fuel plants in many parts of the world. Consequently, the near future is likely to look very different from the past, even without any policy-led acceleration of the deployment of renewables. Indeed, the recent deployment of renewables has tended to surprise on the upside (e.g., actual deployment has tended to outpace IEA projections). It’s unclear whether an elasticity-based model can fully capture these rapidly changing dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary of algorithm</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the model has four types of prices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Variable Costs</strong>: For dispatch decisions, the current variable costs are used (fuel and variable operations and maintenance).</li>
<li><strong>Levelized Cost of Investment</strong>: For forward-looking (investment) decisions, a levelized and forward-looking cost approach adding all cost components is used. For example, one part is <em>forward-looking expectations</em> of future fuel and carbon costs.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-recovery generation cost</strong>: For estimating the total running cost of the power system, a cost-recovery generation cost is calculated. This includes current variable cost, running amortization of capital costs, plus average interest costs (and other components too). The cost-recovery generation cost by generation type is averaged and then transmission and distribution costs are added to produce an overall estimated cost of generating and distributing electricity.</li>
<li><strong>End user power prices</strong> (residential and industrial): these are based on observed prices with an adjustment for changes due to cost changes or carbon pricing. The user can decide what proportion of changes to overall generation cost are passed on. The user can also choose to phase out the estimated electricity subsidy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The outlines of the algorithm are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>End-user prices and GDP changes drive power demand by CPAT sector. (Some components of these prices are lagged one year to avoid circularity as Excel uses sequential rather than optimizing logic.)</p></li>
<li><p>According to historical energy balance data, transmission losses, own use, and net exports are added as fixed proportions of aggregated power demand.</p></li>
<li><p>Current inflexible capacity (renewable, nuclear) are assumed to dispatch at historical capacity factors, and the remainder is allocated to coal and gas according to available capacity using a logit formula based on variable cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Old capacity is retired according to either to defined data on retirement schedules (coal) or an exponential process (other generation types), with cost-based early retirement also included and an option to schedule retirement of coal.</p></li>
<li><p>Aggregate new generation capacity is added to meet expected demand assuming historical capacity factors.</p></li>
<li><p>Renewables are assumed to require both short- and long-duration storage, with assumed piecewise-quadratic total storage requirements, implying piecewise-linear marginal storage requirements. These storage requirements are approximately modelled based on global technical models. These storage costs are added to generation costs for Variable Renewable generation types.</p></li>
<li><p>Needed additions to aggregate ‘effective’ capacity (i.e.&nbsp;additions to expected generation) are then allocated according to another logit formalism based on total levelized costs by generation type, with the cheapest generation types taking the main share of the investment.</p></li>
<li><p>Renewables also have a maximum scale-up rate, set by default to 2 percentage points of total generation for wind and solar additional-generation. This setting can be changed by the user. Needed capacity beyond the limits are reallocated to other generation types according to the logit proportions. If there is still an unmet need for generation (for example in a high-hydro situation where new hydro investment is prohibited), the model will <em>in extremis</em> override VRE scaleup limits and the allowed investment types and invest in proportion to the current proportions of capacity in the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Capacities after retirement and new investment are passed forward as the starting point of the model for the next year.</p></li>

The prices <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> correspond to total (industrial and residential) power prices, as in Section 3.3.3). These prices respond to changes in weighted total generation cost, which is lagged by one year to avoid circularity issue.</p>
<p>A Covid adjustment factor to power demand <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> can be taken into account (see Section 3.3.4.4 - note this is specifically calibrated for the engineer model).

<p>Two different cost-based decisions are considered in the engineer model: the dispatch decision, determining how existing power plants are used, and new investment planning. In both of these decisions, the ‘multilogit’ function is used, with the probability of investment and dispatch of a technology increasing as a function of the price differential with alternatives. A parameter <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> adjusts the shape of the sigmoidal function that can be refined upon review of leading power sector models employing a similar approach. They determine the speed of transitioning between generation types with a different cost. The <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> parameters are set with defaults set subjectively at 2 for both dispatch and investment, which we believe produces realistic results. This parameter can be adjusted in the dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image21.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Figure 3‑15: Dashboard: K parameters</p>
<p>The formula of the multilogit is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{x_{\text{ocft}}}{\sum_{f}^{}x_{\text{ocft}}} = \frac{e^{- K.c}}{\sum_{i}^{}e^{- K.c}}\)</span></p>

<h5 data-number="3.4.2.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dispatch-decision"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.4.2</span> Dispatch decision</h5>
<p>Dispatch decisions are based on a multi-step process.</p>
<p>The model first determines generation from nuclear, renewables, biomass and oil according to their capacity factor and the total supply required. In particular, renewables are assumed to produce power according to their installed capacity multiplied by historical capacity factors.</p>
<p>In the case of renewables, they are assumed to be non-dispatchable meaning their capacity factor is fixed. Nuclear, biomass, and oil generation are assumed to be semi-dispatchable meaning that if power demand falls relative to the base year, they too will reduce their capacity factor proportionally. But they will not increase their capacity factor. For nuclear, the low variable cost makes it economical always to run the plant when available. For biomass and oil, we simplify as we do not wish to model merit order decisions with many different fact (hourly peaking needs, environmental regulations etc).</p>
<p>Then, residual energy demand is determined by an explicit choice between coal and gas based on the variable cost of each (including the carbon tax). In other words, the remaining generation needed after nuclear, renewables, biomass and oil generation are subtracted, is allocated to coal and gas.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{reqge}n_{\text{oc},\text{COA} + \text{GAS},t} = g_{\text{oc},t} - \sum_{\text{fϵ}\left( \text{RE},\text{NUC} \right)}^{}cap_{f}*cf_{f}\)</span></p>
<p>First, we determine the minimum coal needed assuming gas runs at maximum capacity and vice versa for coal. The maximum capacity is by default set to 90%, but the user can adjust it in the dashboard:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Figure 44: Dashboard: Use energy balances or (CPAT) energy consumption data</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Figure 3‑16: Energy balances and energy consumption</p>
<p>For example, for coal:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{minge}n_{\text{oc},\text{COA},t} = \text{reqge}n_{\text{oc},\text{COAL} + \text{GAS},t} - \text{ca}p_{\text{GAS}}*\text{maxC}f_{\text{GAS}}\)</span></p>
<p>Then, the remaining required generation after these minima are allocated to coal and natural gas, <span class="math inline">\(g_{f}\)</span>, is determined based on their relative marginal costs, using the logit formulation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{f} = \frac{e^{- K_{\text{dispatch}}.H_{f}}}{\sum_{f}^{}e^{- K_{\text{dispatch}}.H_{f}}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is restricted to coal or natural gas and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{f}\)</span> is the proportion of the residual generation (after the ‘minimum coal’ and minimum gas’ allocation given limited capacity of the other) allocated to each of coal and gas. The term <span class="math inline">\(H_{g}\)</span> is the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\frac{vc_{P,\text{cft}}}{vc_{P,\text{cft}}^{\text{lc}}}\)</span>, where the (marginal) variable cost is given by <span class="math inline">\(vc_{P,\text{cft}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(vc_{P,\text{cft}}^{\text{lc}}\)</span> is the variable cost of the lowest cost option between coal and natural gas, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(f \in \left\{ \text{coal},\text{naturalgas} \right\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(K_{g}\)</span> is the K parameter specific to generation.</p>
<p>Power generation for coal thus becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g_{\text{oc},\text{COA},t} = \text{minge}n_{\text{oc},\text{COA},t} + \lambda_{f}*\text{residualreqge}n_{\text{oc},\frac{\text{COA}}{\text{GAS}},t}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{residualreqgen}\)</span> denotes the residual power generation from coal and gas.</p>
<p>This procedure gives overall raw generation shares (assuming no PPAs), <span class="math inline">\({\widetilde{\gamma}}_{\text{ocf},t}\)</span>. It is worth noting that to the extent PPAs exist, a fixed capacity factor is used. Therefore, the latter is downscaled if the ‘needed’ coal and gas generation is less than what is implied by their default capacity factors. The total generation mix becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{\text{ocf},t} = \left( 1 - \omega_{\text{oct}} \right)*{\widetilde{\gamma}}_{\text{ocf},t} + \omega_{\text{oct}}*\Omega*\left( \text{ca}p_{\text{ocft}}*CF_{\text{cft}} \right)\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{\text{ocf},t}\)</span> is the generation share after PPAs <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> denotes the percentage PPAs and <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> a downscaling factor if needed generation is different from that which is determined by the raw capacity factors.</p>

<h5 data-number="3.4.2.4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retirement-and-capacity-needed"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.4.3</span> Retirement and capacity needed</h5>
<p>At the start of the analysis, the capital stock is based on electricity generation capacity data by fuel type from Enerdata. Required effective capacity is equal to expected generation capacity and is defined as capacity multiplied by the expected capacity factor -– i.e., the investment is set such that the capacity is sufficient to cover expected peak demand, which is estimated using the power demand equation (see Section 3.4.2.2).</p>
<p>The economic system is expected to plan ahead a few years in advance so that investment takes place to meet the projected demand at the start of each year at the same time as retirement is modeled to happen. Capacity for the first year is thus determined based on IEA data.</p>
<p>For the following years, new capacity is thus equal to the old capacity, less retirements, and plus any new investments needed. The total required generation capacity is given by the expected power demand minus the generation capacity (last year’s capacity less retirements):</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g_{\text{ocft}} = g_{\text{ocf},t - 1} - \sum_{f}^{}ret_{ocf,t - 1} + inv_{ofc,t - 1}\)</span></p>
<p>It is assumed that a generation dependent proportion, <span class="math inline">\(\text{ret}\)</span>, of all generation assets retire each year, equal to the reciprocal of the average lifetime <span class="math inline">\(\text{lif}\)</span> of that generation type.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{re}t_{\text{ocft}} = \frac{1}{\text{lif}}*\text{ca}p_{\text{ocft}}\)</span></p>
<p>For coal, it is worth noting that planned retirement is adjusted based on the coal power plant tracker, which provides power plant data level for a number of countries. Therefore, based on these data, the retirement year of each power plant is determined and the capacity associated is determined from 2022 to 2050<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>. When data do not exist, the above formula is used.</p>
<p>In addition to planned retirement, cost-based early retirement coal is also estimated as additional policies could accelerate retirement for coal power plants. In this respect, the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>First finds the maximum of coal that could be replaced by wind and solar. The maximum coal retirement is estimated as a fixed proportion (default 80%) of coal total effective capacity.</li>
<li>Second, it compares the variable cost of coal with the total cost of wind and solar.</li>
<li>Third, it calculates through a logit formula a proportion of the maximum coal replacement (depending on relative costs):</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{re}p_{\text{oc},\text{coa},t} = 1 - \frac{e^{- K_{i}.H_{r,\text{COA}}}}{\sum_{f}^{}e^{- K_{i}.H_{r,f}}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(H_{r,\text{coa}}\)</span> is the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\frac{vc_{\text{oc},\text{coa},t}}{vc_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{lc}}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_{r,f}\)</span> is the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\frac{vc_{\text{ocft}}}{vc_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{lc}}}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f \in \left\{ \text{coal},\text{solar},\text{wind} \right\}\)</span>. The term <span class="math inline">\(\text{re}p_{\text{oc},\text{COA},t}\)</span> denotes the proportion of coal replacement.</p>
<p>Finally, the estimated proportion <span class="math inline">\(\text{re}p_{c,\text{coa},t}\)</span> is multiplied by the maximum of coal retirement.</p>
<p>Therefore, the total retirement is equal to the sum of planned retirement and cost-based early retirement.</p>

<p>Investment decisions are constrained by non-VRE and VRE limits and are based on two rounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>New investments permitted: A logit function capped by a VRE limit that spreads out investments across technologies based on the cheapest levelized costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Allocated remaining capacity needed: A least-cost merit order algorithm allocates remaining capacity needed according to generation costs across technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Logit function constrained by scale-up limits</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly as dispatch and retirement, new investment is spread out across the cheapest levelized possibilities, according to a multilogit formulation (with K parameter = 2):</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{iv}p_{\text{ocft}}}{\sum_{f}^{}{\text{iv}p_{\text{ocft}}}} = \zeta_{\text{cft}}*\frac{e^{- K_{i}.H_{i}}}{\sum_{i}^{}e^{- K_{i}.H_{i}}}\)</span></p>
<p>Where: <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_{\text{cft}}\)</span> stands for new investments permitted in percentage.

The term <span class="math inline">\(H_{i}\)</span> is the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{ti}c_{P,\text{cft}}}{\text{ti}c_{P,\text{cft}}^{\text{lc}}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\text{ti}c_{P,\text{cft}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{ti}c_{P,\text{cft}}^{\text{lc}}\)</span> define, respectively, the levelized investment cost and the lowest levelized investment cost across fuel types. It is important to note that renewables face a penalty at high levels (i.e.&nbsp;above 75% penetration) as an additional ‘storage systems cost’ could increase costs (see Section 3.4.2.5 on Long-term storage).</p>
<p>Different options are possible for whether new investments are permitted (<span class="math inline">\(iv^{\text{new}}\)</span>):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>If present</em> is the default option and allows new investments in the model if nameplate capacity &gt; 0. Otherwise, no investment is accounted for.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Yes</em> allows the user to introduced planned investments, that is specifying a start year.</p></li>
<li><p><em>No</em> disables new investments.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Manual</em> allows the user to enter data. These data will override the data determined by the model and new capacity will be accounted for as: New Nameplate Investments (MW) = Capacity data entered by the user + Planned Retirement.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 3‑17: Dashboard: Plan or enable new investment</p>
<p>Maximum effective investments, <span class="math inline">\(\text{iv}^{\max},\)</span> are then capped by non-VRE and VRE limits (<span class="math inline">\(\text{VRE}\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\({\text{iv}_{\text{ocft}}^{\max} = g}_{\text{oc},t}*\zeta_{\text{cft}}*VRE_{\text{cft}}\)</span></p>
<p>Default non-VRE limits are set to 5% for coal and natural gas and 2% for hydro, oil, other renewables, nuclear and biomass. Default VRE limits are set to 2% (i.e.&nbsp;for wind and solar).</p>
<p>CPAT allows the user to define non-VRE and VRE scale up rates. The rates reflect a ‘linear’ type constraint. It constrains generation in VRE additions to be a certain percentage of total generation (in gross additions, not net of retirements). For VRE rates, the following rates can be selected: Low (1%), Medium (2%), High (3%), Very High (4%), UserDefined and CountrySpecific (currently set to 2% – except for China 2.5%). The default is country specific.</p>

<ul>
<li>Least-cost merit order</li>
</ul>
<p>The logit approach and the scale-up limitation determines ‘allocated’ investment. But there is still some needed investment that is not allocated. We use a least cost merit order approach to determine the currently ‘unallocated’ investment need.</p>
<p>The least cost algorithm ranks the generation types in terms of the cost and then use up all their available space (within the capacity limits) one by one, starting with the cheapest and so on.</p>
<p>First of all, the algorithm defines the <strong>remaining unallocated investment need</strong>. New effective investment before reallocation are defined as the minimum between maximum effective investments and new investments permitted in order to make sure investments cannot be superior to the maximum capacity. Therefore, this allows to determine the remaining investments needed, <span class="math inline">\(iv^{\text{rem}}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\({iv_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{rem}} = \ iv}_{\text{ocft}}^{\max} - \min{(\text{iv}_{\text{ocft}}^{\max},\text{iv}_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{new}})}\)</span></p>
<p>Second, <strong>generation costs are ranked from the cheapest to the most onerous across technologies</strong> in order to allocate remaining capacity needed.</p>
<p>Third, remaining capacity are thus <strong>allocated in a second round of investment</strong> according to the cheapest technology in a cumulative way.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>total new investments equals investments permitted over the two rounds of investments</strong>, that is before reallocation and after reallocation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(iv^{\text{tot}} = \text{iv}_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{new}} + \ iv_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{rem}}\)</span></p>

<p>Two calibrations are performed in the engineer power model, that is (1) a <strong>calibration on the total electricity generation</strong> and (2) an inferred value for systems cost, <strong>calibrated on the share of coal</strong>.</p>
<p>First, to ensure proper calibration of the engineer power model in 2020, <strong>a COVID adjustment factor can be used to calibrate total electricity generation</strong>. The latter, estimated by the model, is compared to observed data (IEA, 2020). The adjustment factor is calculated as the percentage difference between the estimated and observed data. Results per country can be found in the tab ‘CovidAdjust’. For countries not covered by the IEA database, the factor adjustment is similar to the Covid adjustment on energy consumption (see Section 3.3.4.4). Importantly, in 2021, a rebound effect is introduced.</p>
<p>By default, the adjustment factor is set to 0. However, the user can rely on the adjustment factor by modifying the setting to 1 (see below). It should be mentioned that the lower and upper limits are set at 25%, which means that the factor adjustment cannot be less (more) than -25% (25%).</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image27.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Figure 3‑20: Dashboard: Covid Adjustment</p>
<p>Second, <strong>systems costs are currently inferred by using a calibration on the share of coal in the electricity generation.</strong> This exercise is carried out using observed data in 2019 based on observed data from the IEA and consists of matching observed data for the coal share in the electricity generation. Systerms costs are equivalent to an additional implicit price for coal, <span class="math inline">\(\text{im}p_{c,\text{coa},t}\)</span>. Inferred value for system costs are thus used for the years after 2019, with the exception of the year 2020. The latter is considered as exceptional because of the Covid shock. Therefore, the exercise is repeated for this year, as systems costs could be higher. IEA’s forecasts on the share of coal in total electricity generation for the year 2030 are also reported for information only.</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image28.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Figure 3‑21: Dashboard: Covid Adjustment</p>
<p>For the years 2019 and 2020, the following steps are taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>The share of coal in total electricity generation is calculated for both the power model’s estimates and observed data from the IEA.</li>
<li>To account for the difference between these two values, the “goal seek difference” is expressed as the following distance between estimated and observed coal share: <span class="math inline">\(\left( \text{co}a_{t}^{\text{est}} - \text{co}a_{t}^{\text{obs}} \right)^{2}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\text{coa}l_{t}^{\text{est}}\)</span> denotes the share of coal estimated by the power model and <span class="math inline">\(\text{coa}l_{t}^{\text{obs}}\)</span> represents the observed share of coal for <span class="math inline">\(t \in \left\{ 2019,2020 \right\}\)</span>.</li>
<li>As estimated coal share is often over-estimated compared to observed data, the goal seek difference is thus addressed by increasing prices for coal (i.e.&nbsp;an implicit price component) in order to reduce the difference between estimated and observed coal share. Only positive implicit price components are considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results of additional implicit prices are reported in the tab ‘GoalSeekCoal’ for both 2019 and 2020. By default, CPAT uses the additional implicit prices. However, an option in the dashboard allows the user to turn this assumption off or to manually add the implicit price component.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.4.2.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="storage-decision"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.5</span> Storage decision</h4>
<p>CPAT has a simple model of electricity storage. The required storage consists of two elements, short and long-term. Both long and short-term storage is related to the proportion of renewable energy (VRE) generation as a percentage of total electricity generation. VRE includes wind and solar and other renewables but not hydro and biomass.</p>
<p>Because the model does not represent renewable energy generation profiles, relative quantification of balancing capabilities, or variability in demand, a “system integration cost” is imposed on higher shares of variable renewable energy (VRE). This cost is assumed to be an increasing function of VRE share. This additional cost forms part of the investment decision. The cost of integrating renewables is particularly significant at high levels (i.e.&nbsp;&gt;50% by generation) of renewable penetration into an electricity mix. Against this background, two different types of storage are considered in the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-term storage, which are costly per kWh but cheap per kW (e.g.&nbsp;batteries measured in kWh).</li>
<li>Long-term storage, which are costly per kW but cheap per kWh (e.g.&nbsp;electrolysis and hydrogen tanks measured in kW).</li>
</ul>
<p>For both types of storage there is an additional ‘hours’ ratio, measuring the ratio of battery capacity (kwh) to battery interface (kw), and electrolysers (kw) to hydrogen storage (kwh). Each storage aspect is two-dimensional, meaning that every storage technology is determined by an ‘interface’ (kW) and a ‘storage quantity’ (kWh). The model measures storage according to one ‘numeraire’ and one ratio. For short-term storage, we measure the kWh and assume a standard 4-hour ratio between the kWh and kW in determining the costs. We calculate the kW for long-term storage and assume 1000 hours of storage per kW.</p>
<section id="short-term-storage" class="level5" data-number="3.4.2.5.1">
<h5 data-number="3.4.2.5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="short-term-storage"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.5.1</span> Short-term storage</h5>
<p>Short-term storage in CPAT is satisfied by the batteries. Total storage needs are calculated in hours, which means kWh of storage per kW of average generation (not peak capacity).</p>
<p>The model uses rounded versions of a parameterization derived from global data<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>. The model assumes that the total number of storage for a 100% VRE system is 9 hours, with a quadratic form. We fit the short-term storage needed (in hours) as a (conservative) quadratic function of the VRE. We allocate some percentage of this (currently 100%) to the costs of the power system itself. VRE, <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, includes solar and wind but not hydro (other renewables are neglected). Short-term storage <span class="math inline">\(\text{sst}\)</span> is measured in hours, i.e.&nbsp;kWh/(kWh/h). We also assume a ratio between the kWh of the storage and the kw interface. For conservatism (given our metric is in kWh), we use a low number (2 hours) for the ratio of kWh to kw:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{sst} = 9v^{2}\)</span></p>
<p>By way of example, for a 50% VRE system, the hours needed are <span class="math inline">\(9*{0.5}^{2} = 2.25\)</span> hours.</p>
<p>Therefore, the marginal storage needed is:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{dsst}}{\text{dv}} = 18v^{2}\)</span></p>
<p>The system has assumed to already have invested optimally in the existing storage at current VRE.</p>

<p>CPAT also has a long-term storage model. Long-term storage is additional to short-term storage and is measured according to the cost of the interface (i.e., the electrolyzers rather than the cost of the storage tank). The interface is measured in units of KW. Therefore the proportion of long-term storage per kW of average generation is measured in dimensionless terms (kW per kW or %).</p>
<p>Long term storage <span class="math inline">\(\text{slt}\)</span> costs are treated as effectively punitively costly (in contrast to short term storage), reflecting current costs and technological uncertainties. The long-term storage model assumes zero need for long-term storage below a VRE penetration of 75 percent, raising to 100 percent at a VRE of 100 percent. To this end, long-term storage is viewed as additional to short-term storage, and is needed for VRE over 75%.</p>
<p>Since batteries and hydrogen have other uses, we also have a parameter that determines the proportion of the short-term and long-term storage allocated to the electricity system. This is set to 100% for short-term storage and 33% for long-term storage. This parameter can be modified in the dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image31.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Figure 3‑24: Dashboard: Percent allocation of LT storage costs to VRE</p>
<p>Given its interseasonal storage and geographic independence, we focus on the costs of electrolysers for storage. This storage cost is thus assumed as a long-term storage and is measured with the interface (i.e.&nbsp;electrolysers) as the numeraire. It is given by the following quadratic function:</p>
<p>$ = \left{</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{matrix}
0 &amp; \text{for\ }v \leq 0.75 \\
\left( \frac{v - 0.75}{1 - 0.75} \right)^{2} &amp; \text{for\ }v &gt; 0.75 \\
\end{matrix}\]</span>
<p>.$</p>
<p>Long term storage requirements are measured in MW/MW, i.e.&nbsp;dimensionless units (%). The marginal MW of electrolysers required once VRE penetration reaches 75% is thus varying according to the derivative <span class="math inline">\(2*\frac{v - 0.75}{\left( 1 - 0.75 \right)^{2}}\)</span>.

<p>The levelized cost of the marginal quantity of storage needed to maintain required quantities of total storage is added to the investment costs for VRE.

The CPAT mitigation module, and the IMF tool on which it is based, are primarily elasticity-based models, meaning that future fuel demand is dependent on projected total real GDP growth, and upon future energy prices, modified by mitigation policies such as carbon taxes. The power supply model is also based on elasticities, although it has a more complex structure than in other sectors. It separately models final power demand, and within that overall power demand the generation share of different generation types.</p>

<p>Productivity improvements at power plants reflect improvements in technical efficiency and gradual retirement of older, less efficient plants. Following the IMF Board Paper, for coal, annual average productivity growth is taken to be 0.5 percent based on IEA’s data. For natural gas, nuclear, and hydro, there is likely a bit more room for productivity improvements and baseline annual growth rate of 1 percent is assumed. For renewables, a productivity growth rate of 5 percent is used (i.e., costs halve every 15 years).</p>
<p>For the base year, energy consumption is extracted from energy balances, expressed as total energy consumption net of fuel transformation and transportation. The index <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> denotes the sector Electricity.</p>
<p>For 2020, estimates are based on the previous year’s data adjusted for a one-time exogenous shock, i.e.,&nbsp;Covid (see Section 3.3.4.4).</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{E_{\text{oct}}}{E_{\text{oc},t - 1}} = \left( 1 + \alpha \right)^{- \left( 1 + \epsilon_{U} \right)}\left( 1 + 0.5*\Psi_{\text{ct}} \right)\left( \frac{p_{\text{cEt}}}{p_{\text{cE},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{U,\text{cE}}}\left( \frac{p_{\text{cEt}}}{p_{\text{cE},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{F,\text{cE}}}\left( \frac{Y_{\text{ct}}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{G,\text{cE}}}\)</span></p>

<p>Power generation fuels potentially include coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, biomass wind, solar and other renewables.</p>
<p>Similar to the engineer model, total demand is scaled to generation (which includes additionally transmission losses, energy industry own use and transmission losses). The total production of electricity, <span class="math inline">\(g_{\text{oct}}\)</span>, is driven by the total power demand multiplied by the ratio of generation to demand in the base year.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g_{\text{oct}} = E_{\text{oct}}*\frac{g_{\text{oc},t_{0}}}{E_{\text{oc},t_{0}}}\)</span></p>
<p>For the base year, total electricity generation is based on observed energy balance data, which is the sum of all electricity generation from each fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p>The elasticity model provides two types of information when it comes to forecast generation of each type of fuel: the electricity output and the primary energy used for electricity production for each technology.</p>
<p><strong>The electricity output</strong> from technology <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is defined as the production share multiplied the total production. The production share, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\text{ocft}}\)</span> is derived from observed data and is defined as the ratio between the observed electricity output from fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and the total production, that is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{g_{\text{ocft}}}{g_{\text{oct}}}\)</span>. The production share is assumed to be fixed until 2020. After this date, to accommodate flexible assumptions for the degree of substitution among fuels, the share of fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in generation is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\text{ocft}} = \Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}\left( \frac{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}} \right)^{\epsilon_{\widetilde{E}}} + \frac{\Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}\sum_{i \neq f}^{}\left\lbrack 1 - \frac{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocit}}^{*}}{\text{gn}c_{\text{oci},t - 1}^{*}} \right\rbrack^{\epsilon_{\widetilde{E}}}}{\sum_{j \neq f}^{}\Phi_{\text{ocj},t - 1}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are bound variables ranging over the same range as <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (i.e., OIL, NGA, COA, NUC, WND, SOL, BIO, REN, HYD). In addition, <span class="math inline">\(\text{gn}c_{\text{ocft}}^{*}\)</span> denotes the total unit cost adjusted of thermal efficiency and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\widetilde{E}} &lt; 0\)</span> is the conditional own-price elasticity of generation from fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> with respect to generation cost. Conditional (indicated by <span class="math inline">\(\\tilde\)</span>) here means the elasticity reflects the percent reduction in use of fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> due to switching from that fuel to other generation fuels, per one-percent increase in generation cost for fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, holding total electricity generation fixed. Generation cost elasticities are larger than corresponding fuel price elasticities as an incremental increase in fuel and non-fuel generation costs has a bigger impact than an incremental increase in fuel costs alone.</p>
<p>From the above equation, fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>’s generation share decreases in own generation cost. It also increases in the generation cost of fuel <span class="math inline">\(i \neq f\)</span>, where the increase in fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>’s generation share is the reduced share fuel <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\text{ocft}}\)</span> times the term in square brackets) multiplied by the (initial) share of fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in generation from all fuel alternatives to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}}{\sum_{f \neq i}^{}\Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}}\)</span>:</p>
<p>NB: The actual equation in CPAT also reflects that nuclear and hydro should normally not grow beyond current levels. Therefore the model reallocates any excess growth for nuclear and hydro to other generation types. The equation above thus becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\text{ocft}} = \Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}\left( \frac{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}} \right)^{\epsilon_{\widetilde{E}}} + \frac{\Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}\sum_{f \neq i}^{}\left\lbrack 1 - \iota_{\text{cft}} \right\rbrack^{\epsilon_{\widetilde{E}}}}{\sum_{f \neq i}^{}\Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}}*\delta^{\text{add}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\iota_{\text{cft}} = \frac{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{\text{oct}}^{\text{add}} = \frac{\text{TotExces}s_{\text{oc},\text{NUC} + \text{HYD},t}}{\left( 1 - \Phi_{\text{oc},\text{HYD},t} - \Phi_{\text{oc},\text{NUC},t} \right)}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>The energy used of each technology</strong> <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> <strong>in electricity production</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, to electricity output, the base year corresponds to observed data, with the exception of wind, hydropower, solar and other renewables which are equal to electricity output. Therefore, for the following years, the energy used in electricity production is expressed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{ocft}} = E_{\text{ocft}}*\left( \frac{1}{1 + \alpha_{f}} \right)^{t}\frac{F_{\text{ocf},0}}{E_{\text{ocf},0}}\)</span></p>
<p>The fuel use is equal to the electricity generated multiplied by an efficiency improvement over time <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{f}\)</span> specific to the generation type <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>

<p>The CPAT mitigation module offers two models that can be used for the power sector: the elasticity-based model and the techno-economic (‘engineer’) model. The former uses marginal fuel price increases and price elasticities to determine the shares of each type of generation, while the latter explicitly models the capacity of different types of generation, with capacity expansion to meet desired power demand. The user can choose to use elasticity, the engineer model, or a simple average of the two. Since the data documented in this section are fed into the engineer model, we will briefly review that model here.</p>
<p>The engineer model is based on four elements (see Figure 1):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The power demand model</strong>, which is based on income and price elasticity of electricity demand.</li>
<li><strong>The retirement model</strong>, which includes cost-based ‘early retirement’ options for coal.</li>
<li><strong>The investment model</strong>, which models the addition of new capacity.</li>
<li><strong>The dispatch model</strong>, which models renewables and nuclear as operating continuously and accounts for the trade-off between coal and gas based on price.</li>
</ul>

<p>Technologies are not always consistent across sources, and the CPAT model takes specific technologies into account. For transparency, Table 1 summarizes the mapping of technologies considered in the CPAT model. We select specific significant technologies to represent each CPAT technology. For instance, we use onshore wind to represent wind power in general (onshore and offshore), as it accounted for 92% of installed wind capacity in 2024, according to the IEA (2024). Other renewables constitute a separate category, as it includes all other renewable technologies. For more information, please refer to the Appendix A, Section A.1. Technology Mapping.</p>

<p><strong>Integration process</strong>: Where multiple sources provide data for the same parameter, we employ a simple average methodology after applying necessary adjustments for consistency. This approach balances the strengths of different sources while mitigating individual source limitations. Table 17 in <em>Appendix A, Section A.2</em>. Assumptions outlines the different assumptions underlying the construction of variables in the power sector according to various data sources and correction in CPAT.</p>
<p><strong>Standardization Requirements</strong>: Due to different underlying assumptions across data sources, several standardization adjustments are implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Costs in time</strong>: The latest version of CPAT is based on <strong>2021 data</strong>, including costs expressed in USD and in real terms (net of inflation). As costs may vary in time depending on the status of the power plant, the approach aims to establish a time series based on available data points across different sources. The IRENA, GNESTE and BNEF databases display nominal data and are adjusted to the model year. Other monetary data are adjusted according to the US GDP deflator indicator (including historical CPAT data that could not be updated).</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency Standardization in Net Caloric Value (NCV)</strong>: Differences between net and gross calorific values (GCV) are typically about 5% to 6% of the gross value for solid and liquid fuels, and around 10% for natural gas. Based on the original BNEF GCV data, we estimate the NCV by applying a 10% increase for natural gas and 5.5% for other technologies. For more information, please refer to <em>Appendix A, Section A.2. Definitions</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Overnight Costs</strong>: Capital costs in principle exclude interest payments during the construction phrase. For more information, please refer to <em>Appendix A, Section A.2. Definitions</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity factor</strong>: This factor measures how often a power plant operates during a given period. It is expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing the actual power output of the unit by the maximum possible output. This ratio indicates the share of a unit’s capacity that is used.</li>
<li><strong>Lifetime Assumptions</strong>: Lifetime information is provided for all types of technologies in CPAT except for biomass. A lifetime of 35 years for power plants specialized in biomass is assumed.</li>

<p>The engineer power model is based on CapEx forecasts, subject to a learning rate methodology for renewable energies. This methodology is essential for projecting future costs and planning investments in these technologies. The data source and methodology differ for historical and forecast data. The methodology used for historical data (2014 to 2023) is included in Appendix B, Section B.2. Time Evolution of Capex, as it is not updated here.</p>
<p><strong>Data Source</strong>: - CCDR-EEX</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: For wind and solar, we use the learning curve method to forecast global investment expenditure from 2023 to 2050. Other technologies, namely coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear, are not subject to a learning rate or different scenarios and are assumed to be constant over time. We use capacity projection from the IEA National Policies in APS World (APS) and the IEA National Power Decarbonization 2050 in NZE World (NZE), used in the Country Climate and Development Reports Energy Transition Analysis (CCDR EEX) methodology. The APS scenario is used as the medium scenario and the NZE scenario is used as the high scenario, in line with the recommendation in the CCDR EEX Approach Note.</p>

<p>To estimate power sector technoeconomic characteristics, simple averages of the available data points are computed. The process includes averaging the values by data source. This step is important because data sources may provide different data at a given time for the same technology. Different data sources are used and prioritized depending on their availability.</p>
<p><strong>Data Sources</strong>: - IRENA - GNESTE - BNEF</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong>:To construct a dataset with 2021 as the CPAT as-of-date year, we accept data between 2021 and 2023, taking the latest available year. We convert the data where necessary to include in the final dataset (see Table 8):</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital expenditure (CapEx) in USD/kW</li>
<li>Fixed operational expenditure (OpEx) in USD/kW/year</li>
<li>Variable OpEx in USD/kWh</li>
<li>Capacity, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and efficiency in percentage</li>
<li>Lifetime in years</li>
</ul>
<p>To maintain consistency with the rest of the model, the data is indexed to the currency of the base year (see Appendix A, Section A.3. Adjusting for inflation). This process is also used to fill in data gaps (see Table 9). The methodology then differs slightly for each dataset but ensures that the data is accurately processed and standardized for subsequent use (see the Section Update Workflow for a technical guide through the update process).</p>
<p>For clarity and easier reviewing of the data, we also express the processed data as a percentage of global values for CapEx and OpEx variables (see Table 10). To do so, we apply the following formula:<br>
% of global = (value / (global value)) * 100</p>

<p>Decommissioning costs are one of the components of power generation costs. It takes place after a power plant has been taken out of service. It should be noted that retirement and decommissioning are two different things. Decommissioning indicates that the power plant is no longer producing electricity, but that assets such as buildings, turbines, boilers, or other equipment are left in place. The decommissioning process refers to the dismantling, environmental remediation, and restoration of the site. While much of the literature focuses on the cost of decommissioning for nuclear power plants, data on decommissioning costs for other types of technology is scarce. Thus, data from older sources sometimes remain the most reliable. Prices are therefore indexed to inflation (reference year: 2021), but more recent sources need to be found. For more information, please refer to Section 3.4.1. Power prices and generation costs in the online documentation.</p>
<p><em>NB</em>: Transmission costs as a percentage of capital expenditure are not currently used in CPAT.</p>
<p><strong>Data Sources</strong>: - Raimi (2017) provides estimates of decommissioning costs by technology type (offshore and onshore wind, coal, concentrated solar, solar photovoltaic, oil, and gas) based on a literature review. The data are expressed in 2016 US dollars and adjusted to inflation using a normalization factor for 2023. - The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) states that “the lack of cost data from actual decommissioning projects is a major hindrance to the benchmarking and validating of decommissioning cost estimates.” For the time being, the World Nuclear Association (WNA) estimates decommissioning costs at around 9 to 15% of initial CapEx. An approximation is used to take into account an average of 13% of CapEx. - Hydro Power &amp; Dam construction estimates, based on information on dam destruction in the United States, that decommissioning costs can be 20-40% of new construction costs.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: In CPAT, decommissioning costs are expressed as a percentage of overall upfront costs. Decommissioning and transmission costs are based on estimates provided by several data sources. The average is calculated and then transformed to be expressed as a percentage of capital expenditure (see Table 11). For nuclear, estimates from two studies are averaged. The ratio of available data for decommissioning costs to overall CapEx (USD/MW) data by technology type is then used to express decommissioning costs as a percentage of CapEx. For hydroelectricity, based on the study mentioned below, decommissioning costs are assumed to be 20% of capital expenditure. For other renewables and bioenergy, the average decommissioning costs estimated for the other technologies are used as decommissioning costs for now.</p>

<p>Utility-scale battery storage systems differ slightly from other technologies as they store electricity produced by generators or pulled from the electric grid. These systems then redistribute the power based on the demands. It is worth noting that battery storage costs are commonly expressed in kWh, although one fraction of these costs – the power cost – is measured in kW. Several types of batteries exist, typically varying from 1h to 4h storage batteries. In CPAT, costs for battery correspond to 2h storage battery. For more information, please refer to Section 3.4.2.5. Storage decision in the online documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Data Sources</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bogdanov et al., 2019 (LUT model)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: For storage data, data directly extracted from the LUT model is used (see Table 12). Since the study provides data every five years (i.e., starting from 2015), estimates for the year 2021 are approximated using the following weighting approach: <span class="math display">\[
\text{CAPEX}_{2021} = 0.8 \times \text{CAPEX}_{2020} + 0.2 \times \text{CAPEX}_{2025}
\]</span> - Battery: CapEx, variable, and fixed OpEx are in USD/kWh - Battery interface: CapEx and fixed OpEx are in USD/kW and variable OpEx in USD/kWh - Water Electrolysis: CapEx and fixed OpEx are in USD/kW and variable OpEx in USD/kWh - Lifetime in years</p>

<p>Capacity is used directly in the model. It is also used to derive the capacity factor and efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Data Sources</strong>: Installed capacity data comes from two sources: - The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA): Used for data prior to 2019. The data must be supplemented by the breakdown of fossil fuels, as these are aggregated. The methodology is not covered here since it is not used anymore. - IRENA: Used for data after 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: IRENA data on renewable energy capacity represents the maximum net capacity of power plants and systems using renewable energy sources. Data is collected from a variety of sources, including national statistics, industry reports, and questionnaires. The IRENA data processing script is designed to process and transform IRENA data on electricity installed capacity for integration into the CPAT model. The script classifies technologies and maps countries and regions from the database to the CPAT model. It extracts data from 2020 to 2023, already expressed in MW. This methodology ensures accurate regional mapping and categorization of power capacities.</p>

<p>Planned coal retirement plays a role in investment decisions within the model. For each future year, the model adjusts the available coal-fired generation capacity by subtracting the planned retirements derived from detailed coal plant monitoring data. This closure schedule is incorporated into the model to ensure that capacity shortfalls created by these closures are identified and can be filled by new investments in a timely manner. In the absence of plant-level closure data, a standard depreciation rule is applied. For more information, see Section 3.4.2.4.3 Retirement and capacity needed in online documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Data Source</strong>: - Coal Power Plant tracker</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: Based on the power plant data level, the retirement year of each power plant is determined from 2024 to 2050. Data is downloaded from the Coal Power Plant tracker, mapped to CPAT country/region, and implemented in the tab. See Table 14 for an example of coal retirement data.</p>
<p><em>NB</em>: Power plants are removed if status = cancelled, shelved, mothballed.</p>

<p>In CPAT, there are four ways to consider the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). It is by default income-dependent (see Table 11) but can also be technology-dependent (i.e., it can be specified for each technology). It can be specified for the baseline and policy scenario, and finally defined globally by the user, as shown in Figure 1. For more information, please refer to section 3.4.1.6. Concept 3: Cost-recovery estimated total cost of generation in online documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Data Sources</strong>: - Damodaran (2025) - Steffen (2020)</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: The cost of capital is a “forward-looking measure comprising the time value of money and a premium for risk (as well as potentially further factors, such as taxes and transaction costs). The cost of capital is equal to the discount rate as used in investment appraisals, such as net present value calculations.”</p>
<p>According to Steffen (2020), four dimensions are key in defining WACC: - LIBOR: Used to compare the cost of capital over time. - Country Factor: Affects the overall investment risk of a project. - Technology Factor: Investment risk differs between different technologies. - Time or Policy Factor: Investment risks can vary over time, and regulatory frameworks can affect investment risks.</p>
<p><strong>LIBOR</strong>: Steffen (2020) uses the 12-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a common benchmark interest rate, in different currencies, to compare the cost of capital over time.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 5 - General Interest Rate Level Over Time,(Steffen, 2020, p.5)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Country Factor</strong>: Country risk premium determined by Damodaran (2023) is used. The author considers the degree of indebtedness, pension/social service commitments, revenues/inflows to government, the stability of revenues, political risk, and the implicit backing from other entities to compute a country risk premium dataset. He estimates an adjusted country risk premium by multiplying the default spread by the relative equity market volatility for that market (Std dev in country equity market/Std dev in country bond).</p>
<p><strong>Technology Factor</strong>: Different technologies do not have the same risk, depending on their maturity, even among renewable technologies. For instance, solar PV has been deployed significantly since 2015, leading to a lower operational risk than wind, and therefore to a comparably lower WACC.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Factor</strong>: The methodology includes an adjustment in the case of new power purchase agreements (PPAs), which leads to a reduction in the WACC of 4% (based on IEA 2021 methodology).</p>

<p>In CPAT, emissions are projected in two ways: i) energy-related emissions are based on a model, that is estimations of energy consumption (see Section 3.3) in the different sectors are converted into GHG emissions by the means of an emission factor; and ii) non-energy related emissions are forecasted based on particular assumptions. The table below summarizes the approach taken to forecast emissions forward.</p>

<p>Emissions have <strong>two dimensions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pollutants</strong>: Carbon dioxide (<span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span>), Methane (<span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span>), Nitrous oxide (<span class="math inline">\(N_{2}O\)</span>) and Fluorinated gases (F-gases). GHG emissions include those in the UNFCCC inventories (<span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N_{2}O\)</span> and Fluorinated Gases (or F-gases), including PFCs, HFCs SF<sub>6,</sub> and NF<sub>3</sub>). Note that the mitigation also presents short-lived air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NOx, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, NMVOC, BC, OC, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO); the methodology for these is covered in the air pollution module documentation.</li>
<li></li>
<li><strong>Sectors</strong>: Energy-related sectors (i.e., Transport, Power, Industry, Building, and Other energy use), as well as non-energy-related sectors (i.e., Agriculture, Industrial Process, LULUCF, Waste and Other). It is important to note that some parts of the sectors accounted for in the non-energy sectors are also reflected in energy-related sectors. For instance, Agriculture also appears under the ‘Building’ sector, under ‘Food and Forestry’ sub-sector (for more information, see Appendix B).</li>
</ul>
<p>CPAT considers territorial rather than consumption-based emissions. This means that, for example, if some natural gas is imported but subject to leaks upstream in extraction before it arrives at the country concerned, these methane emissions are not counted in the emissions of a natural gas power station. However, an extracting country will include those leaks. Similarly, the emissions from imported goods are not included, whereas those associated with exported goods are included.</p>
<p>In what follows, we first define the role of emission factors and their sources. Second, we present the approach adopted for energy-related <span class="math inline">\(_{}\)</span> and non- <span class="math inline">\(_{}\)</span> by fuel and sector. Third, we describe the estimation of emissions in non-energy sectors. We use the index <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to refer to the type of GHG (<span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N_{2}O\)</span> and F-gases).

Total GHG emissions are the sum of both energy and non-energy related emissions: <span class="math inline">\(em_{\text{oc},\text{GHG},t} = em_{\text{ocER},\text{GHG},t} + em_{\text{ocNER},\text{GHG},t}\)</span>. Finally, the section explains how NDCs are accounted for in CPAT.</p>

<p>An emission factor is a coefficient that converts activity data into GHG emissions. It represents the average emission rate for a given fuel relative to consumption units. For instance, in the power sector, coal emits 3.931 ton of <span class="math inline">\(_{}\)</span> per ktoe.</p>
<p>The emission factors used are (as a default) fuel-, country- and sector-specific emissions from IIASA’s GAINS model<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>. The user also has the option to use global emissions factors from the IEA.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> The emission factors given by the IEA are scaled at a worldwide level, while those from IIASA are country specific. Also, IIASA emission factors include process and fugitive emissions in the distribution network from natural gas (which is why it is necessary to rescale them through the overall calibration to 2019 emissions). All emission factors are sector and fuel specific.</p>
<p>The user has the possibility in the dashboard to select the source of emission factors to be used. Global IEA emissions factors are also an option.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.5.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="energy-related-emissions"><span class="header-section-number">3.5.4</span> Energy-related emissions</h3>
<p>Energy-related emissions are estimated across sectors and by aggregating sectors (i.e., Transport, Power, Industry, Building, and Other energy uses) for the four GHGs (i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\text{CO}_{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N_{2}O\)</span> and F-gases). In this section, the index <span class="math inline">\(u = E\)</span>, denotes the energy-related sectors.</p>
<section id="carbon-dioxide-co_2-and-methane-ch_4" class="level4" data-number="3.5.4.1">
<h4 data-number="3.5.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="carbon-dioxide-co_2-and-methane-ch_4"><span class="header-section-number">3.5.4.1</span> Carbon dioxide (<span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span>) and methane (<span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span>)</h4>
<p>Energy-related <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span> emissions are calculated by multiplying energy consumption by emissions factors. Emissions are multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(10^{- 6}\)</span> as the emission factor <span class="math inline">\(\text{ef}\)</span> is given in tCO2e/ktoe and the fossil fuel consumption <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is given in ktoe, to obtain emissions in mtCO2e. We neglect this unit transformation in the description below.</p>
<p>In 2019, these emissions (both <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span> energy-related emissions) are scaled to UNFCCC inventory emissions, meaning they are multiplied by a factor such that base-year emissions are equal in the model and the inventory. In other words, the model is adjusting <span class="math inline">\(_{}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(_{}\)</span> emissions to match the model and inventory. This scaling factor is close to 1 for <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span>, but are typically greater than one for <span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span>. This scaling applies only to the aggregate emissions and not to the price effect. It only applies to the core modelled emissions of energy related <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span> and not to any other gas or any other UNFCCC sector.</p>
<p>After 2019, these emissions are thus calculated, for each fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and for a year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, as the multiplication of the fossil fuel’s consumption for year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by the sector’s associated to emission factor:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(em_{\text{ocEsfpt}} = F_{\text{ocEsft}}*ef_{\text{cEsfp}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span> represents scenario, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, sector, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, fuel type, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, GHG (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> the year.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CH_{4}\)</span> emissions are determined across all fuels and across all sectors (and grouping sectors). Total energy emissions are determined as the sum across sectors and fuels (for energy related emissions u=E)</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(em_{\text{ocpt}} = \sum_{s}^{}{\sum_{f}^{}e}m_{\text{ocsfpt}}\)</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, total energy-related <span class="math inline">\(_{}\)</span> <strong>and</strong> <span class="math inline">\(_{}\)</span> emissions are augmented by energy distribution losses and methane energy-related emissions are subject to a calibration. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total energy-related</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{2}}\)</span> <strong>emissions</strong> include energy distribution losses, that is the sum of combustion emissions and the fugitive and venting <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span> emissions. The latter are mostly from natural gas pipes plus coal mines. These are a part of energy-related <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span> emissions but they are not combustion.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Total energy-related</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{4}}\)</span> <strong>emissions</strong> are calibrated to 2019 shares. The factor is the 2019 ratio of methane emissions to the sum of the total global warming potential<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> from methane emissions <span class="math inline">\(\text{gwp}\)</span> and the methane fugitive and venting emissions <span class="math inline">\(\text{fug}\)</span>. Then, projections are made by multiplying this factor with the sum of the <span class="math inline">\(\text{gwp}\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(\text{fug}\)</span> for the current year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(t \geq 2019\)</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(em_{ocE,CH_{4},t} = \frac{em_{ocE,CH_{4},2019}}{\text{gw}p_{ocE,CH_{4},2019} + \text{fu}g_{ocE,CH_{4},2019}}*\left( \text{gw}p_{ocE,CH_{4},t} + \text{fu}g_{ocE,CH_{4},t} \right)\)</span></p>
<p>CPAT also covers the other parts of the UNFCCC inventories (i.e.&nbsp;GHGs other than <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span> and methane, and other categories than energy-related GHGs). For these emissions, the UNFCCC inventories are scaled by various growth rates, detailed in the next section.</p>

The user should note that this rate can be adjusted in the dashboard.</p>

<p>Figure 3‑29: LULUCF emissions decline rate</p>
<p>At the global level, this aligns with approximately the midpoint of IAMs’ projection for LULUCF. Where the country assumes ‘additional mitigation effort in non-energy sectors’ LULUCF GHGs decline at the rate of energy <span class="math inline">\(_{}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For this section, <span class="math inline">\(u = L\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is considered that a defined amount of emissions can be subtracted yearly, based on the 2019 level. Therefore, we introduce the LULUCF emissions decline <span class="math inline">\(\text{Δe}m_{L,t}\)</span> (in annual %, in absolute value of the start year).</p>
<ul>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(p = CO_{2}\)</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span>, we create a condition to model the sink activity of LULUCF (<span class="math inline">\(em_{\text{ocLpt}} &lt; 0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(&gt; 0\)</span>). In both cases, we subtract an annual capture of <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span> based on the LULUCF emissions decline <span class="math inline">\(\text{Δe}m_{\text{Lt}}\)</span>. If the emissions of the previous year <span class="math inline">\(t - 1\)</span> are positive, we scale the emissions with the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a\text{me}_{cLp,t}}{\text{ame}_{\text{cLp},t - 1}}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a\text{me}_{cLp,t} = \ \frac{em_{P,cLt}}{em_{B,cLt}}\)</span>, which represents the ratio between energy-related emissions under a policy and baseline scenario.</p>

<ul>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(p = CH_{4}\)</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The same logic as for <span class="math inline">\(CO_{2}\)</span> is used, without considering the condition for sinks.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; 2019\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(em_{\text{ocLpt}} = \frac{em_{\text{ocLp}\left( t - 1 \right)}}{\text{am}e_{B,L,t - 1}}*\text{am}e_{P,Lt} - \left| em_{\text{ocLp},2019}*\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \right|\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(p = N_{2}O\)</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of <span class="math inline">\(N_{2}O\)</span>, we assume the level of emissions to grow accordingly to the population growth <span class="math inline">\(lp_{\text{grow}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; 2019\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(em_{\text{ocLpt}} = \frac{em_{ocLp,t - 1}}{\text{am}e_{B,L,t - 1}}*\text{am}e_{P,Lt}*\left( 1 + lp_{\text{grow}} \right) - \left| em_{\text{ocLp},2019}*\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \right|\)</span></p>

</ul>
<p>In the case of F-gases, we assume the level of emissions to grow accordingly to the population growth <span class="math inline">\(lp_{\text{grow}}\)</span>. However, it is the only case where we do not consider the LULUCF emissions decline.</p>

<p>CPAT harmonizes National Determined Contributions (NDCs) for 192 countries to show target GHG emissions levels (excluding LULUCF) in 2030, based on several major NDC characteristics, that is conditionality and sectoral coverage. This section presents the different types of NDCs. Country cases illustrating how NDCs are calculated in CPAT are presented in Appendix D - Examples of NDCs calculations.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.5.6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-ndcs"><span class="header-section-number">3.5.6.1</span> Types of NDCs</h4>
<p>There are different types of NDCs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business as usual (BAU) targets</strong>: NDC target is a percent reduction from the country’s BAU scenario. For example, Albania’s NDC is 11.5% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the baseline scenario in 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed targets</strong>: NDC target is a fixed level of GHG/CO2 emissions in target (future) year. For example, Argentina’s NDC is a cap of 359 MtCO2e net emissions in 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Historical targets</strong>: NDC target is a percent or fixed reduction from the level of emissions in past years. For example, Australia’s NDC is 26 to 28% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Intensity targets</strong>: NDC target is a reduction in emissions intensity. For example, Uruguay’s NDC is emissions intensity reduction (GHG/GDP) of 24% in CO2 from 1990 levels.</li>
<li><strong>Unquantifiable targets</strong>: NDCs with no specific emissions reduction commitments. For example, Saudi Arabia’s NDC: “The Kingdom will engage in actions and plans in pursuit of economic diversification that have co-benefits in the form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission avoidances and adaptation to the impacts of climate change, as well as reducing the impacts of response measures.”</li>
</ul>
<p>NDCs could also present conditional and unconditional targets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unconditional targets</strong>: Countries would use their own resources and technologies to achieve unconditional goals.</li>
<li><strong>Conditional targets</strong>: Countries would need international support to achieve these (more ambitious) goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>CPAT excludes LULUCF emissions from NDC calculations, so in case LULUCF emissions were included in initial document, the goals are recalculated with LULUCF, using the latest available data for LULUCF GHG emissions and user-identified growth parameters for these emissions. If not stated, we assume that the NDC target includes LULUCF.</p>
<p>By default, CPAT models the impact of carbon pricing on energy-related emissions. Hence, for countries with high levels of emissions from non-energy related sources (agriculture, waste, LULUCF), the calculations would imply a high burden on energy sector to achieve NDC goals. For more information, see Appendix D - Examples of NDCs calculations, which presents examples of NDCs calculations.</p>

<p>The fiscal revenues section in the mitigation tab of CPAT is organized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional information, including <strong>total fuel expenditure</strong> broken down per fuel and sector grouping and <strong>revenues/losses from price controls</strong> broken down per fuel. These data are not used in the calculation of fiscal revenues.</li>

<h3 data-number="3.6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-7"><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> Overview</h3>
<p>Revenues from mitigation policies are estimated by comparing any revenues from the policy and fuel taxes, net of any outlays from fuel subsidies, in the baseline scenario with those in the policy scenario. Fiscal revenues in CPAT are calculated for several types of taxes, by fuel and sector. Revenue-raising policies include carbon taxes, ETSs with auctioned allowances, increases in fuel/electricity excises, and reductions in fossil fuel subsidies. Revenue-reducing policies include expenditures (e.g., on renewable subsidies) and regulations (which reduce the base of pre-existing fuel taxes).</p>
<p>CPAT differentiates two types of revenues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carbon tax revenues</strong>, which are the result of the carbon tax multiplied by emissions factor and energy use.</li>
<li><strong>Full revenues</strong>, which include other taxes, VAT changes, excise duties, existing ETS schemes, etc. The changing revenues according to a carbon tax are not just simple revenues but also any changes associated with full revenues. For instance, there could be changes in subsidies due to changes in energy consumed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A general formula for fiscal revenues calculations is:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{re}v_{\text{ocfgt}} = F_{\text{ocfgt}}*\varphi_{\text{cgft}}*\text{nc}p_{\text{ocfgt}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{re}v_{\text{cfgt}}\)</span> is the fiscal revenues from fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{cfgt}}\)</span> is the energy consumption, <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{\text{cgft}}\)</span> is the sector-fuel coverage and <span class="math inline">\(\text{nc}p_{\text{cfgt}}\)</span> denotes the tax (policy) rate per unit of energy consumption.</p>
<p>In the dashboard, the graph below shows total additional (vs.&nbsp;baseline) fiscal revenues from the policy net of renewable energy subsidies. Note that this includes base effects on existing taxes and subsidies, so even a revenue-neutral policy that nevertheless changes the base of existing taxes will have some effects on these, net, revenues.</p>

<p>Fiscal revenues are calculated according to the selected power model (Elasticity, Engineer or Average) and are expressed in billions of dollars (in real terms based on the year 2021) and % of GDP. Please note that revenues can be broken down per fuel. Total revenues are composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenues from the baseline scenario</strong> raised for each fuel and sector coverage. The estimation of these revenues follows the general formula for fiscal revenues presented above (i.e.&nbsp;the carbon tax multiplied by emissions factor and energy use).</li>
<li><strong>Revenues from existing excises and other taxes, including consumer-side subsidies</strong>. This describes all existing taxes and consumer side subsidies. Excise and other taxes are composed of:
<ul>
<li>Consumer-side subsidy: <span class="math inline">\(cs_{\text{ft}}\)</span>;</li>
<li>Fixed/ad val part/other: <span class="math inline">\(\text{fa}o_{\text{ft}}\)</span>;</li>
<li>Current carbon tax: <span class="math inline">\(\text{xc}t_{\text{ft}}\)</span>; and</li>
<li>Current ETS permit price: <span class="math inline">\(\text{xets}p_{\text{ft}}\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For each fuel, we multiply the fuel consumption (minus the other energy use part, which is assumed not to be covered by excises) by the sum of all the current excises. If the existing ETS is EU ETS, then the excise and other taxes from current ETS permit price are not taken into account. It is worths noting that for coal and natural gas, the formula below is used across sectors as these fuels are broken down per data on excise taxes in the sector groupings (i.e.&nbsp;industry, buildings and power sectors).</p>
<p>Revenues from existing excises and other taxes, <span class="math inline">\(\text{revEx}i_{\text{ft}}\)</span>, are thus estimated as follows:</p>
<p>$i_{} = \left{</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{matrix}
\left( F_{\text{ocft}} - F_{\text{oc},\text{oen},\text{ft}} \right)*\left( cs_{\text{cft}} + \text{fa}o_{\text{cft}} + \text{xc}t_{\text{cft}} \right) &amp; \text{if\ }\text{ExistingETS} = \text{EUETS} \\
\left( F_{\text{ocft}} - F_{\text{oc},\text{oen},\text{ft}} \right)*\left( cs_{\text{cft}} + \text{fa}o_{\text{cft}} + \text{xc}t_{\text{cft}} + \text{xets}p_{\text{cft}} \right) &amp; \text{if\ }\text{ExistingETS} \neq \text{EUETS} \\
\end{matrix}\]</span>
<p>.$</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{ft}}\)</span> denotes energy consumption and <span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{oen},\text{ft}}\)</span> energy consumption in the Other Energy Use sector grouping.</p>
<p>For electricity, revenues from additional excise tax are also estimated based on the power prices determined in the engineer power model. The additional excise tax is multiplied by the energy use and the consumer-side tax/subsidy in the residential sector and the tax/subsidy on industrial users in the non-residential sector.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Revenues from additional excise tax</strong> (if it exists – additional excise tax can be inputted in the Manual Inputs tab.) raised for each fuel and sector, calculating as the additional excise tax multiplied by the energy use. For electricity, however, it is worth noting that revenues from additional excise tax relies on the engineer power model estimations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Revenues from VAT</strong>. Following the same logic as for existing excises and other taxes and additional excise taxes, revenues from VAT are calculated across sector grouping as the multiplication of the fuel consumption (minus the other energy use part <span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{oen},f,t}\)</span>, which is assumed not to be covered by the VAT) by the associated VAT payment rate <span class="math inline">\(\text{va}t_{\text{cft}}\)</span>:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{revVA}T_{\text{ft}} = \left( F_{\text{ocft}} - F_{\text{oc},\text{oen},\text{ft}} \right)*\text{va}t_{\text{cft}}\)</span></p>
<p>For electricity, revenues from VAT are obtained by multiplying the energy use by the VAT payment in the residential non-residential sectors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Losses from producer-side subsidies</strong>. Producer-side subsidies represent a loss and are thus subtracted from total fiscal revenues. They do not affect the calculation of prices in CPAT and thus revenues unless they are phased out, if they exist. Note that implicitly the underlined that we are using has already been adjusted for producer-side subsidies, in particular in the case of coal. Producer-side subsidies, <span class="math inline">\(\text{cstP}s_{\text{ocft}}\)</span>, are defined as the product between the per-unit subsidies<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>, <span class="math inline">\(\text{pus}F_{\text{ocft}}\)</span>, and the subsidized demand, <span class="math inline">\(\text{subDe}m_{\text{ocft}}\)</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{cstP}s_{\text{ocft}} = \text{subDe}m_{\text{ocft}}*\text{pus}F_{\text{ocft}}\)</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subsidized demand is determined based on both global demand data from the IEA and domestic demand data directly estimated in CPAT. The estimation of subsidized demand differs depending on the fuel considered. For oil, subsidized demand is equal to global demand as it is a global traded product. Subsidized demand for coal and natural gas represent 50% of global demand and 50% of domestic demand. Finally for electricity, only domestic demand is used and depends on the power model selected. Subsidized demand can also vary according to the global energy demand scenario selected in the dashboard.</li>

<ul>
<li>Per unit subsidies are taken from the Prices section of CPAT. For coal, gasoline and natural gas, per unit subsidies correspond to the average across all sectors. Importantly, per unit subsidies are equal across sector grouping. For electricity, producer-side subsidies are retrieved from the non-residential sector (i.e.&nbsp;denoted as industrial sector) of the Power Prices section of CPAT, determined in the engineer power model.</li>
</ul>

If specified by the user, <span class="math inline">\(\text{cstRe}n_{\text{ocft}}\)</span> represents the cost of implementing renewable electricity subsidy (or tax).

Importantly, it is assumed that the energy demand responds to prices in the private sector, although the institutional setup could, in some markets, play a role in preventing prices from determining supply and demand.</p>

<p>Figure 3‑33: Efficiency costs and co-benefits in the presence of prior-tax and carbon charge</p>
<p>At any point, the height of the demand curve reflects the benefit to consumers from an extra unit of consumption, while the height of the supply curve (drawn as flat here because constant returns to scale is assumed) reflects the cost to firms of producing an extra unit. If there is no pre-existing tax or subsidy in the market, the consumer and producer price are equal, and the market equilibrium is efficient (leaving aside environmental impacts) because the benefit to consumers from the last unit consumed equals the cost to firms of supplying that unit.</p>

<p>Introducing a carbon tax in a country is distortionary by nature from a local perspective (since it does not correct for a local externality per se), but with the aim of contributing to a global reduction in emissions (i.e., it contributes to reducing global externalities). Suppose a carbon charge, equal to a carbon tax times the fuel’s CO2 emissions factor, is now applied to the fuel. The charge drives a wedge between the price paid by fuel users and the price received by fuel producers and reduces fuel use, resulting in an economic efficiency cost indicated by the shaded triangle <em>abg</em>. This efficiency cost is equal to the loss of benefits to consumers from the fuel reduction, the integral under the demand curve or trapezoid <em>adeg</em>, less savings in production costs to firms, rectangle <em>bdeg</em>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the efficiency cost can be interpreted as the loss in consumer and producer surplus (<em>jkga</em>) less revenue gains to the government where the latter is rectangle <em>jkba</em>. Consumer surplus reflects the benefits of fuel use to consumers less the amount they pay for the product (<em>jkga</em>) and is reduced from triangle <em>hkg</em> to triangle <em>hja</em> by the carbon charge. Producer surplus reflects revenue gains to firms less production costs consumption but is zero with and without the carbon charge as constant returns are assumed.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.7.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="efficiency-cost-in-the-presence-of-a-prior-tax"><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1.2</span> Efficiency cost in the presence of a prior tax</h4>
<p>It is now supposed that a prior tax on fuel use is applied. This prior tax drives a wedge between the consumer and producer price in the initial equilibrium as indicated in Figure 3‑33. The efficiency cost of the carbon charge is now given by trapezoid <em>acfg</em>. Again, this reflects losses in benefits to consumers from the fuel reduction, trapezoid <em>adeg</em>, less savings in production costs, rectangle <em>cdef</em>. Alternatively, it is the loss in consumer surplus, trapezoid <em>jlma</em>, less revenue gains to the government, rectangle <em>jlca</em>.</p>
<p>In this case the efficiency cost has two components: (i) one-half times the carbon charge (per ton of CO2) times the overall CO2 reduction; and (ii) the pre-existing tax per unit of fuel use, times the fuel reduction, and aggregated across fuel markets.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.7.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="efficiency-costs-in-cpat"><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1.3</span> Efficiency costs in CPAT</h4>
<p>The efficiency cost can be (approximately) computed by the ‘Harberger triangle’, that is, one-half times the carbon charge expressed per unit of fuel use times the fuel reduction. If the carbon charge is applied to multiple fuel products, the efficiency cost is the sum of Harberger triangles across the fuel markets. Equivalently, the efficiency cost is simply one-half times the carbon charge (per ton of CO2) times the overall CO2 reduction, which corresponds to the integral under the marginal abatement cost (MAC) schedule where the latter is the horizontal summation of individual MAC curves for all the behavioral responses promoted by the carbon charge.</p>
<p>In CPAT, the efficiency costs follow the Harberger methodology, i.e., efficiency costs are treated as deadweight costs, <span class="math inline">\(\text{ddw}\)</span>. These costs correspond to the area of the trapezoid described above, which is expressed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{dd}w_{\text{ft}} = \frac{\left( \text{nc}p_{\text{ft}} - xcp_{\text{ft}} \right)}{2}*(F_{P,ft} - F_{B,ft})\)</span></p>
<p>Where the first term <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\left( \text{nc}p_{\text{ft}} - xcp_{\text{ft}} \right)}{2}\)</span> represents the average of new and pre-existing tax, respectively denoted <span class="math inline">\(\text{nc}p_{\text{ft}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{xc}p_{\text{ft}}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(F_{P,ft} - F_{B,ft}\)</span> corresponds to the change in fuel consumption from the baseline to the policy scenario.</p>

<p>If it is now supposed that there are also local air pollution or other domestic environmental costs associated with use of the fuel product as indicated in Figure 3‑33. The reduction in fuel use from the carbon charge reduces these costs by rectangle <em>ncfo</em>, which corresponds to the domestic environmental co-benefits. In short, the area <em>acfg</em> is presumably due to the externality created from fossil fuel use in the first place – and hence that is why the entire <em>ncfo</em> area could be a benefit. The net economic benefit is defined as the domestic environmental co-benefits—excluding global climate benefits—less efficiency costs. This is shown by trapezoid <em>noga</em>, as the co-benefits exceed the efficiency cost. More generally co-benefits might offset a portion of (rather than more than offsetting) efficiency costs in which case net economic benefits are negative.</p>

<p>Externalities are deadweight losses from the tax before revenue recycling and do not include revenue recycling and tax interaction effects. In the dashboard of CPAT, energy externality costs are calculated under the baseline scenario and include costs above the marginal cost, that is costs related to air pollution, congestion, road damage and accidents and global warming. The sum of these externalities, including the supply costs and the potential VAT, actually defines what is called the ‘efficient price’.</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image43.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Figure 3‑34: Dashboard: Global energy demand scenario</p>
<p>These costs are displayed by fuel (i.e.&nbsp;coal, natural gas, electricity and liquid fuel, gasoline, diesel, LPG and kerosene) and sectors grouping (except for liquid fuels) and broken down by various components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Supply costs</strong> as defined in the Prices section of CPAT.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Air pollution costs</strong>. These costs are associated mortality and morbidity attributed to air pollution. Averted mortality is valued using a Value of the Statistical Life (with the method selected by the user) and morbidity, measured as years lived with disabilities, is valued using a fraction of wages. See Section 6.7 of the Air Pollution module for methodological details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Road accident costs</strong> and <strong>Congestion costs</strong><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>. The main road transport co-benefits of a carbon tax are a reduction in road accidents (from a reduction in driving, changes in the vehicle fleet, less aggressive driving, etc.) and a reduction in congestion (from a reduction in driving, an increase in car sharing, changes in the vehicle fleet, changes in transport timing decisions, etc.). Externality costs are estimated based on the baseline and policy forecast (i.e.&nbsp;adjusted for the fuel price change using a country-specific elasticity) accidents/congestion. The monetary value of accidents (multiplying fatalities by value of statistical life) and congestion (multiplying time lost in traffic times value of travel time) is then computed. Finally, the change in value of accident/congestion is divided by the change in motor fuel consumption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Global warming costs</strong> are by default defined at the global level. These costs are estimated based on the damage per ton CO2 (in real USD$ 2021) and the level of CO2 emissions under both scenarios. Note that several social cost of carbon can be selected:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The damage per ton of CO2 is by default set to a <strong>social cost of carbon</strong>, fixed to 75USD$ in 2030, implying an annual rise in real terms from 2018 of the social cost of carbon of 4%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Estimated social costs by Ricke et al.&nbsp;(2018)</strong> for which the national social cost of carbon discount rate and elasticity of marginal utility can be modified. Note that Ricke et al.&nbsp;(2018) estimates are country specific. More information can be found in the tab “SCC” of CPAT.</p></li>
<li><p>The social cost of carbon can also rely on the <strong>Global US EPA estimates</strong> with a 2.5% discount rate.</p></li>

<p>CPAT provides an assessment of climate co-benefits associated with carbon pricing and fossil fuel price reform. Welfare benefits induced after the introduction of the carbon tax include the monetized following items (in real USD$ 2021), which are estimated based on the description of the costs described in the above section:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Averted climate damages (national)</strong> is defined as the difference between the total national global warming costs in the baseline and the policy scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Averted air pollution mortality/morbidity</strong> is taken from the Air Pollution module. The air pollution welfare gains are calculated from reduced mortality and morbidity attributed to improvements in air pollution. Averted mortality is valued using a Value of the Statistical Life (with the method selected by the user) and morbidity is valued as a fraction of wages. See Section 6.7 of the Air Pollution module for methodological details.</li>
<li><strong>Averted road accidents</strong> are taken from the transport module and represent the change in the number of road accidents induced by the implementation of the policy selected by the user, which thus corresponds to externality benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced congestion</strong> is taken from the transport module. In the same vein, external benefits from reduced congestion results from the change in traffic induced by the implementation of the policy selected by the user.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency costs</strong> are defined as the deadweight costs resulting from the carbon tax (i.e.&nbsp;the average of existing and new carbon tax introduced) and the change in fuel consumption for each fuel considered, including electricity.</li>

<p><strong>It is important to note that the validation exercise differs from the calibration</strong>. While the calibration performed for some variables throughout the mitigation module prevents the model from deviating from observed data (i.e.&nbsp;for 2019 to 2021), particularly in the context of Covid, the validation analysis covers a broader time horizon and aims to explore how the mitigation module performs against other models or to compare it against the literature. The analysis also includes sense-checking and parameter sensitivity analysis of the parameters defined in the mitigation module. The validation is organized as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Elasticities estimations</strong>. As CPAT is mainly driven by elasticities with respect to prices and economic activity, an econometric analysis is carried out to compare the elasticities used in CPAT and those obtained from an empirical analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comparison of CPAT against other models</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ex-post studies</strong>. This section presents the literature’s estimates of the effectiveness of carbon pricing with respect to emissions and compares them to the CPAT results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hindcasting</strong>. The hindcasting exercise aims at testing CPAT’s forecasts against observed data. It searches to evaluate the performance of the used assumptions when trying to reproduce historical information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parameter Sensitivity Analysis</strong>. The analysis explores the sensitivity of a set of selected parameters.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Before deep diving into the validation analysis, a first step in the validation process is performed to ensure that CPAT produces reliable data, especially for the data fed into the rest of the validation analysis. To further validate CPAT and check its functionality for all countries the T and Tt scenarios have been created in the Multiscenario Tool to test 826 parameters used in CPAT. The T-scenarios use average power models and show how CPAT behaves under different carbon taxation and how these parameters change. There are six testing scenarios:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>T0-T6</strong>, when T0 has no carbon tax;</li>
<li><strong>T1</strong> (small carbon tax scenario) introduces 12$ carbon tax with 20$ target carbon tax;</li>
<li><strong>T3</strong> (medium carbon tax scenario) introduces 36$ carbon tax with 60$ target carbon tax;</li>
<li><strong>T6</strong> (high carbon tax) introduces 120$ carbon tax with 200$ target carbon tax; and</li>
<li><strong>The T2, T4 and T5</strong> introduce intermediate rates for comparison.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to these scenarios, the scenarios denoted Tt (i.e.&nbsp;T0t-T6t) use engineer model instead of Average power models and hold the same assumptions and carbon tax rates as the T scenarios described above (i.e.&nbsp;T0-T6). In order to test CPAT, the following steps were performed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Settings</strong>. The T0-T6 use average model, while T0t – T6t scenarios use engineer model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model runs</strong>. The MT is run using the same defaults.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data</strong>. The database is then compiled, retaining CPAT’s output on 826 parameters for 218 countries.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The scenarios aim to provide data for further Parameter Sensitivity, hindcasting and comparison analysis, as well as signal any problems with country specific results</strong>, i.e.&nbsp;due to the poor data quality. Based on the outcomes, we classify countries into working and ones which produce spurious results. The Table on Countries coverage presented in the User Guide results from this testing.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.8.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.8.2.1</span> Introduction</h4>
<p>This section describes the results from the estimation of some of the fuel demand equations incorporated in CPAT. The aim is to</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver an empirical view of the elasticities with respect to price and economic activity;</li>
<li>Establish the size and direction of any linear trend in fuel consumption; and</li>
<li>Reflect on the difference between the value of the elasticities and trends estimated in this study and those currently used in CPAT.</li>
</ul>
<p>Elasticities describe the percentage change in a dependent variable in response to a percentage change in an independent (driving) variable. As an example, a price elasticity equal to -0.3 implies that a 100% increase in the price delivers a 30% reduction in fuel consumption. In the case of models using data undergoing a logarithm transformation, the elasticity with respect to a given variable is simply the estimated coefficient on that variable.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.8.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology"><span class="header-section-number">3.8.2.2</span> Methodology</h4>
<p>The approach used here reflects underlying CPAT model and database structure in relation to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frequency of data and timespan</strong>. In the estimation we used annual data ranging between 2000 and 2018, i.e.&nbsp;the dataset currently incorporated in CPAT. This is a panel dataset in which information for a set of fuels consumed in a set of sectors (and their driving variables) is observed across time and countries (here taken as the unit dimension of the panel).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Driving factors</strong>. Consumption of a fuel in a specific sector is assumed to be a function of fuel price (in that sector) and of the overall level of economic activity (as measured by the GDP), with both variables expressed in real terms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Static functional form</strong>. The whole impact of a change in a driving variable, say, price, unfolds within the year covered by that observation. This means that last year’s prices have no impact on this year’s and future consumption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sectorial disaggregation</strong>. Results are reported based on the disaggregation underlying the current set of elasticities in CPAT (industrial, service, residential and transport) but data are available for a number of industrial subsectors and transport modes (as shown in Appendix B - Energy balances, Figure 3‑47) which are used in the estimation. This implies that we are able to produce estimates for the elasticities of a fuel consumed in any industrial subsector, so that the range of these estimates for the industrial sector as a whole is indicated as with a boxplot in Figure 3‑37 and Figure 3‑38.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fuel disaggregation</strong>. Results are reported based on the fuels underlying the current set of elasticities in CPAT (coal, electricity, natural gas, other oil products, biomass, diesel and gasoline). In the case of other oil products, we are able to rely on two fuels in the estimation: kerosene and lpg.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We estimated the fuel demand below for each combination of sector and fuel for which estimation was deemed relevant and feasible:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\begin{matrix}
\text{ln\:f}c_{\text{it}} = \alpha_{i} + \beta_{1}\text{\:ln\:}y_{\text{it}} + \beta_{2}\text{\:ln\:}p_{\text{it}} + \beta_{3}\text{\:t} + \epsilon_{\text{it}} \\
\end{matrix},\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(fc_{\text{it}}\)</span> indicates the consumption of a specific fuel at time <em>t</em> in country <em>i</em> in a specific sector, <span class="math inline">\(p_{\text{it}}\)</span> indicates the price for that fuel and <span class="math inline">\(y_{\text{it}}\)</span> the overall level of GDP in the country. There are no indices in relation to the sector and the fuel in the equation as estimation is conducted for each combination of fuels and sectors. The individual effects <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{i}\)</span> reflect constant (across time) factors which affect fuel consumption in a specific sector in a specific country given the value of the independent variables in the model. An example for these factors could be energy efficiency policies affecting fuel consumption regardless of the level of economic activity and price. Finally, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is a linear time trend. We also introduced a time effect <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{t}\)</span> but it was never found to be statistically significant when a linear trend was also included.</p>
<p>In terms of relevance, we excluded sectors for which the CPAT dataset contained data covering less than 0.5 GTOE while in terms of feasibility we required a minimum of about 300 observations for a sector-fuel combination to be included in the analysis. As a consequence, the number of units (countyries) used in the analysis varied from more than 150 in the case of gasoline used for road transport to 13 in the case of coal used for non-energy use or otherwise not included in other industrial subsectors.</p>

<h5 data-number="3.8.2.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adopted-estimators"><span class="header-section-number">3.8.2.2.1</span> Adopted estimators</h5>
<p>The following estimators were implemented: 1) the between estimator (BE); 2) the pooled OLS estimator (POLS) and; 3) the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CMG) estimator of Pesaran (2006). The results from the Between and Pooled OLS estimator are reported only for those cases when they produce consistent estimates, ie. when regressors are not correlated with individual effects as assessed by the Hausman test. The choice of these estimators was motivated by the aim of assessing the long-term impact of driving factors on fuel consumption - despite the use of a static functional form in CPAT - and evidence of Cross-Sectional Dependence (i.e.&nbsp;correlation across the units in a panel dataset).</p>
<p>More precisely, the choice of adopting these estimators is motivated by the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The BE produces consistent estimates of long-run coefficients for a panel with adequate number of observations across time and units (in our case countries) as formally discussed in Pesaran and Smith (1995). It also produced the best estimate of long-run price coefficient for gasoline in the Monte Carlo simulation discussed in Baltagi and Griffin (1984), although estimates from POLS were not markedly different.</p></li>
<li><p>The POLS produced the most robust forecasts (assessed based on the RMSE) in the Monte Carlo study in Baltagi and Griffin (1984). In the same study, the BE produced very similar results, although with (slightly) higher errors.</p></li>
<li><p>The CMG estimator produces unbiased estimates when cross-sectional dependence (CSD), which was assessed based on the test in Pesaran (2015), is correlated to included regressors in the model. We used robust standard errors (Beck and Katz 1995; Driscoll and Kraay 1998) to take into account cross-sectional dependence but this is a valid approach only if the unobserved factors responsible for correlation across units are not correlated to variables in the model, in our case fuel price and GDP. Although the CMG estimator is robust to any form of Cross-Sectional Dependence, the extent to which it captures long-term impact of driving variables in a static model is not clear.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Two versions of the equation above are implemented in the case of the POLS and CMG estimators: one with a global linear trend, one with a trend allowed to vary across countries. Considering the number of estimates we obtain we report only those which were statistically significant at the 10% level and conform to economic theory, e.g.&nbsp;positive elasticity on economic activity and negative on the fuel price.</p>

<p>Figure 3‑37 compares the estimates of price elasticities obtained here with those used in CPAT for the transport (quadrant A), residential (quadrant B), industrial (C) and service sector (D). Estimated elasticities are similar to those used in CPAT in the case of the:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>residential sector, with the exception of electricity for which we estimated -0.1 - considerably lower than the -0.4 value used in CPAT;</p></li>
<li><p>industrial sector, with the of exception of diesel for which CPAT uses the high value of -1.1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Difference between the elasticity in CPAT (-0.61) and the value estimated here (-0.19) for gasoline in the transport sector might be related to the fact that only the estimate from the CMG estimator can be used in the comparison with CPAT. Low estimates for price elasticities of gasoline in road transport are however very established in the literature. A recent survey, Galindo et al (2015), indicated -0.10 and -0.30 for short- and long-term elasticities, respectively, with our estimate (-0.19) falling right in the middle of this range.</p>
<p>The difference between elasticities estimated here and those used in CPAT is noticeable in the case of the Service sector. CPAT postulates fuel consumption being more price responsive than demand in industrial sector while our estimates point at elasticities being similar to those estimated in the residential sector. Assuming that there is considerable overlap between fuel uses in the service sector and in households (space heating, air conditioning and everyday electrical appliances), our findings of similar elasticities in the service and the residential sector seem plausible. Considering the difference between our estimates and CPAT and the growing importance of the service sector globally, this is a topic which should be explored further in the next iteration of CPAT.</p>

<p>Figure 3‑38 compares the estimates of the elasticities with respect to economic activity with the values used in CPAT for the transport (quadrant A), residential (quadrant B), industrial (C) and the service sector (D). Estimated elasticities are similar to those in CPAT in the case of the:</p>

With regard to the former, our estimates (ranging between 0.31 and 0.53 across fuels) are close to the results from the meta-analysis in Galindo et al (2015) indicating short- and long-run income elasticities equal to 0.26 and 0.46, respectively. CPAT is currently using the higher value of 0.57 for gasoline and 0.65 for other oil products. With regard to the service sector, CPAT incorporates a stark difference between elasticities for biomass and diesel (with values up to 0.41) and those for electricity and natural gas (with elasticity as high as 0.9). In contrast, our estimates are more homogeneous across fuels with values at most as high as 0.7.</p>

<p>CPAT includes a term called “annual autonomous improvement in efficiency” which conveys the annual percentage reductions in fuel consumption due to increasing energy efficiency. The intensity of this factor is stronger in the case of transport (average of about -0.5% across fuels) compared to the other sectors for which average for each fuel varies between -0.27 and -0.06%</p>
<p>Our estimate of a global linear trend for the sector-fuel combinations included in this study presents quite a different picture, as a negative trend in consumption could be estimated only for coal and other oil products. In the case of biomass, electricity and natural gas the trend is positive. In the case of diesel and gasoline consumption in the transport sector, not reported in Figure 3‑39, the estimated models pointed out at non-statistically significant linear trend.</p>

<p>The empirical validation pointed out that the elasticities with respect to price and economic activity in CPAT tend to be on the same ballpark as those estimated here, with some exceptions mainly related to road transport and the service sector.</p>
<p>This exercise pointed out that estimated global linear trends are considerably different from the assumed impact of energy efficiency used in CPAT. With hindsight, this is not surprising, as estimated global linear trends include the impact of energy efficiency but also changing preferences for a specific fuel or the impact of changing sector decomposition. As an example, one would expect a positive linear trend in the case of biofuels in the transport sector due to the impact of policies facilitating substitution away from fossil fuels to renewable sources. CPAT might benefit from continuing to disentangle the perceived impact of energy efficiency (as currently done) especially if that coefficient could be linked to explicit policymaking.</p>
<p>This empirical validation has provided an opportunity for a thorough assessment of CPAT and how econometric analysis may inform values used in the model. This resulted in a number of considerations that will be explored in the next iteration of model development. In particular, CPAT is likely to benefit from including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Elasticities estimated on an extensive dataset spanning about 4 decades which has been recently put together. Although this is a key development allowing the implementing of more sophisticated approaches and functional forms described below, as a first step, it seems helpful to focus on the estimators considered in this note.</p></li>
<li><p>A more focused measure of economic activity. The use of GDP to measures economic activity for each sector included in CPAT is not supported by best practice in the energy literature and involves the risk of producing unstable estimates, and therefore forecasts. As an example, if the share of a sector’s economic activity in the whole economy changes in a specific direction, CPAT would under- or over-forecast fuel consumption in that sector. As historical data for more focused economic activity indicators are available for all sectors in CPAT, one would need to assess whether one could obtain forecast time series which are needed by the model to make this approach feasible.</p></li>
<li><p>A more explicit treatment of long-run estimates. CPAT can incorporate the long-run / short-run distinction explicitly through an Error Correction Model (ECM) specification which is included in the macro-economic model of the World Bank or - perhaps more simply</p>
<ul>
<li>maintain its current specification but include two sets of elasticities, one for long-run and the other for short-run forecasts, with the timing of the switch between the two informed by empirical evidence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A more explicit analysis of the impact of cross-price elasticities. This is a very important factor for a model assessing consumption for each fuel like CPAT. Systematic approaches to fuel substitution bring their own set of challenges (Agnolucci and De Lipsis 2020), to the extent that a simpler ad-hoc method may be preferable at least as a starting point, perhaps focused only on the substitution of specific fuels in specific sectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Exploring feedback mechanisms between the variables incorporated in the model and their possible endogeneity. This does not seem a considerable concern considering the variables currently used in CPAT but may deserve its own empirical exploration if more focused indicators of economic activity (as consequence of point 2 and more likely to be endogenous) are used in the model.</p></li>
<li><p>Assessing the extent to which elasticities vary across sectors and countries. The current version of CPAT includes the possibility of differentiating elasticities with respect to price and economic activity based on whether a sector is in a country belonging to the Lower Income, Lower Middle Income and Upper Middle-Income group on one side, and High-Income Country. The next phase of model development should thoroughly explore this possible source of heterogeneity alongside other sources, e.g.&nbsp;the possibility of allowing heterogeneous responses across industrial subsectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Trying to disentangle the impact of energy efficiency from changing preferences for a specific fuel, either through variables related to explicit policymaking or incorporating evidence from specific policy events</p></li>

<p>Over the current section, we will compare CPAT results and projections with other models over a selection of indicators. We will therefore:</p>

<p>This section is dedicated to the assessment of the CPAT baseline results. The latter is observed and compared with other models/sources through time series. We use two sources for comparison. The first and main source used is the Stated Policies (STEPS) scenario of the IEA World Energy Outlook 2021, extracted from RFF’s Global Energy Outlook 2022 database. The second source used for comparison is Enerdata’s long-term Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC).</p>
<p>In both cases, the comparison is established based on specific indicators available in the different datasets (from Enerdata and from the IEA). We will therefore challenge both Average and Engineer models of CPAT.</p>

<p>The IEA’s STEPS scenario reflects current policy settings based on a sector-by-sector assessment of the specific policies that are in place, as well as those that have been announced by governments around the world.</p>
<p>Data for solar has been added manually from the IEA WEO 2021 as it was not included originally in the RFF dataset.</p>
<p>We only have 3 points of data from the IEA: 2019, 2020, and 2030. The indicators selected are: Total CO2 emissions, Primary energy consumption by fuel, and Electricity generation by fuel.</p>
<p>Overall, the comparison shows comparable results between CPAT and the IEA STEPS scenario. Indeed the figures below suggest outcomes of same order of magnitude for the observed year (i.e.&nbsp;2019, 2020 and 2021) and long-term projections are similar.</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image49.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note that it is not possible to observe the inflection point in 2022 in the IEA projection, as data point for the year 2022 is not available. As defined by RFF, Primary energy consumption displays the estimated energy content of fuels consumed prior to any conversion process.</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image50.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Oil in CPAT is the aggregation of Diesel, Gasoline, LPG, Kerosene, and Other Oil Products. A different aggregation could explain the difference observed in order of magnitude for Oil.</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image51.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In Europe and Eurasia, discrepancies are mainly driven by the results of Russia. It is important to note that there is no data for Solar Electricity Generation per country in the RFF-GEO dataset for the IEA STEPS scenario. Strong divergence should be noted between the two models on the nuclear generation.</p>

<p>The sensitivity analysis is the observation of the evolution of the emissions depending on the carbon tax level. We will use the data from Enerdata in order to establish the analysis. We are taking into account both Average and Engineer models of CPAT. The graphs are indexed on the baseline scenario, as a 100% of emissions.</p>
<p>We will only consider 3 indicators: Total CO2 emissions, Energy related CO2 emissions - Power sector, and GHG emissions, exc. LULUCF. The focus is at the world level, for the year 2030. We see good alignment between the two models for all three indicators and both CPAT power model choices (average or engineer).</p>
<p>Note here we abstract for any differences in baseline. See the previous and next sections for that topic.</p>

<p><em>It should be noted that Enerdata’s scenarios were formed before the Covid crisis.</em></p>
<p>This comparison is based on different carbon tax scenarios (including the baseline scenario), target for 2030: 0 USD/tCO2, 20 USD/tCO2, 40 USD/tCO2, 60 USD/tCO2, 80 USD/tCO2, 100 USD/tCO2, and 120 USD/tCO2. These scenarios are computed using the average and the engineer models of CPAT in order to add another layer of comparison. Enerdata presents CO2 MACC, which is going to be used as an equivalent to the target carbon tax. There are 3 points of data: 2025, 2030 and 2035.</p>
<p>We consider 5 indicators: Total CO2 emissions, Energy related CO2 emissions - Power sector - Industry - Buildings - Transportation, and GHG emissions, exc. LULUCF.</p>
<p>Results show comparable results, with both models having similar slops. Enerdata’s outcomes are, however, higher and aligned with pre-covid results of CPAT, suggesting that the Covid adjustment implemented in CPAT may explain the difference. In addition, it is worth mentioning that CPAT is calibrated on IEA’s data in the year 2019 to 2021, and IEA’s assumptions are less conservative than Enerdata when it comes to the share of coal power plant in the future.</p>

<p>Overall, CPAT’s results are similar to Enerdata’s results. With a few exceptions, the figures below report a similar order of magnitude and comparable directions. In this comparison, the average power model of CPAT provides closer estimates to Enerdata’s scenarios.</p>

<p>The power sector validation is made using the World Bank’s EPM model. The World Bank’s Electricity Planning Model (EPM) is a long-term, multi-year, multi-zone capacity expansion and dispatch model. The objective of the model is to minimize the sum of fixed (including annualized capital costs) and variable generation costs (discounted for time) for all zones and all years considered, subject to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand equals the sum of generation and non-served energy</li>
<li>Available capacity is existing capacity plus new capacity minus retired capacity</li>
<li>Generation does not exceed the max and min output limits of the units</li>
<li>Generation is constrained by ramping limits</li>
<li>Spinning reserves are committed every hour to compensate forecasting errors</li>
<li>renewable generation constrained by wind and solar hourly availability</li>
<li>Excess energy can be stored in storage units to be released later or traded between the other zones</li>
<li>Transmission network topology and transmission line thermal limits</li>
</ul>
<p>The model is an abstract representation of the real power systems with certain limitations. EPM is used mostly to perform least cost expansion plans as well as dispatch analyses.</p>

<p>The main objective of this analysis is to validate the accuracy of the CPAT results by comparing them with selected results from the EPM model, for different countries. The following outputs are compared:</p>

<p>The EPM model presents several different scenarios per country. Each scenario is defined by a 2030 carbon budget, most of the time defined as a 40% emission reduction relative to the BAU scenario. However, while the carbon budget is an input for the EPM model, it is an output for CPAT. Therefore, we used a goal seek in order to define a 2030 target carbon price in CPAT, which brought us to $40 t/CO2. This is an only approximately equivalent comparison: exact matching was difficult.</p>
<p><strong>We use the Engineer model of CPAT for the entire comparison.</strong></p>

<p>Please note the following caveats on the approach followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>EPM has a constraint in emissions and look to 2040 (80% emission reduction relative to BAU on average), but we work with 2030. In other words, we use a proportional ratio to set the target goal seek.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li><p>The fuel classification in CPAT does not exactly match the EPM ones. Therefore EPM “Fuel oil” will be considered as CPAT “Other oil products” (“Oil” in the legend), EPM “Onshore wind” and “Offshore wind” will be considered as CPAT “Wind”, and EPM “Geothermal” as CPAT “Other RE”. Storage is invested in CPAT but not reported so we do not compare it here.</p></li>
<li><p>CPAT’s New Investments (MW) are considered spreaded in time, which explains their continuous aspect.</p></li>

<p>The comparison in terms on types of fuels in the energy mix and the order of magnitude of the shares reflect similar results. It is worth noting that the EPM model shows a higher share of wind in the electricity generation for some countries (e.g.&nbsp;Vietnam).</p>

<p>Despite voluminous literature on the carbon tax, few empirical works have investigated the effectiveness of a carbon tax and ETS in reducing emissions. Figure 3‑40 provides a first attempt to compare the estimates according to three different methods employed in the literature, that is counterfactual scenario and the estimation of semi-elasticity. It is worth noting that this comparison might be imperfect as under a counterfactual scenario some estimates have been annualized based on the policy implementation window, similarly to Green (2021). Moreover, Figure 3‑40 reports both short- and long-term estimates.</p>
<p>Two main key findings stand out from ex-post quantitative assessments of carbon pricing policies since 1990.</p>
<p>First, experience with carbon pricing and hence the empirical evidence is primarily from developed and emerging economies. In particular, studies assessing the effectiveness of a carbon tax focus on OECD countries or Northern European countries, which implemented a carbon tax earlier and for which time series data are available. Only few recent studies evaluate ex-post estimates of the effects of carbon tax on CO2 emissions across the world. At the national level, particular emphasis is placed on British Columbia, Sweden and the United-Kingdom. With respect to the assessment of the ETS, the focus is, not surprisingly, on the EU, China, Germany and the United States.</p>
<p>Second, the estimates for overall emission reductions from carbon pricing are minimal to modest, falling in the range of 0 – 2 percent per annum, with significant variations across sectors, but also across countries (Green, 2021).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, several caveats have to be factored in before drawing conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Carbon prices so far have had low coverage, low prices, or both</strong>. The sample size as well as the time horizon might still be too restricted to accurately examine the effect of a carbon pricing instrument. In this respect, empirical results acknowledge that the effects of taxes on emission reductions largely depend on the comprehensiveness of the instrument design and the level of the carbon tax (Metcalf, 2021).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The carbon price appears to have a non-linear effect</strong>, indicating that its effect becomes stronger above a certain threshold (Aydin &amp; Esen, 2018). For instance, emissions reductions attributable to the EU ETS during the second phase (2008-2012) are greater than during the first stage (2005-2007). In the first phase, allowances were freely allocated. In the second phase, the cap was tightened and prices higher.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Control variables introduced in empirical studies may poorly capture the effect of the instrument alone</strong>. At the same time, isolating the effect of the carbon pricing instrument from other policies - which are not always considered as environmental policy measures - may lead to insignificant results. However, evaluating a carbon pricing instrument in conjunction with other instruments can lead to effectiveness (see, for example, Shmelev &amp; Speck, 2018, who find that a carbon tax is effective when evaluated with a set of policies).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The effects of rational ignorance may kick in and eliminate any impact</strong>. Given the transaction costs of investing in low-carbon technologies, agents may not be responsive to a price signal set below a certain threshold.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When it comes to the ETS, generalized free allocation can mitigate incentives</strong> (e.g., through the creation of resource rents and barriers to entry). In addition, as more and more emissions are covered by ETSs (such as in China or in the EU) uncertainty on future prices may blunt the responsiveness of agents.</p></li>

<p>In order to compare CPAT’s semi-elasticity of CO2 emissions against the literature, the following settings are used:</p>

<li><p>Due to low carbon prices, we employ a low step function, that is <strong>$10 per ton of CO2</strong>. Such a step function is comparable to studies estimating semi-elasticities.</p></li>
<li><p>The model is run for all countries for which data are available and factors in the total CO2 emissions of <strong>171 countries</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>As CPAT is forward-looking, it covers the period <strong>2019-2035</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>As most of studies analyzed their results against a counterfactual scenario, CO2 emission changes in CPAT are compared to the baseline scenario. The estimation of the short- and long- term semi-elasticities is calculated as follows:</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ul>
<li>The total CO2 emissions in ton/CO2 are retrieved from CPAT under the baseline and policy scenarios over the period 2019-2035.</li>
<li>Annual changes are thus computed between the baseline and the policy scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term semi-elasticities</strong> are arbitrarily calculated as an average of the annual changes over the period 2019-2023.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term semi-elasticities</strong> are estimated as an average of the annual changes over the entire period (i.e.&nbsp;from 2019 to 2035).</li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Finally, CPAT holds the advantage to compare C02 emission changes <strong>across sectors (i.e.&nbsp;industry, power, residential and transport)</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The table below presents the results. Long-term semi-elasticities are greater than short-term ones, indicating that changes that are not possible in a short period of time are more realistic over a longer time period. When looking into the range of CPAT’s estimates across all sectors, results are comparable with those of the literature (see Figure 3‑40 above). At the sector level, the power sector records the highest decrease on the long run, which is consistent with Rafaty et al.&nbsp;(2020)<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The hindcasting exercise aims at testing CPAT’s forecasts against observed data. It searches to evaluate the performance of the used assumptions when trying to reproduce historical information. In short, the process assumes an historical point in time as its base year, and projects all relevant variables. Key indicators are selected and their projections are compared to real/observed data.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.8.5.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology-2"><span class="header-section-number">3.8.5.2</span> Methodology</h4>
<p>The current results were obtained using a hindcastable version of CPAT (CPAT 1.0pre_043) with the help of the Multiscenario tool (MT v219). This is an out-of-sample forecasting exercise that simulates data from the year 2000 onward. The analysis uses CPAT methods to forecasts domestic prices, energy consumption and resulting emissions. Observed international prices for the forecasted period were fed as inputs to the simulation.</p>
<p>At the first stage, the focus is set on the forecasts of emissions; in particular, on GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF) and on energy-related CO2 emissions. The scenarios are run using six countries as test samples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia (AUS)</li>
<li>Brazil (BRA)</li>
<li>China (CHN)</li>
<li>South Africa (ZAF)</li>
<li>United Kingdom (GBR)</li>
<li>United States (USA)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No Policy interventions were modeled</strong>, so the results correspond to the ‘Baseline’ output of the model.</p>
<p>The hindcasting exercise relies on an adapted version of CPAT and the MT files, where the first year of calculations is set to an historical point in time. All relevant data tables (e.g.&nbsp;energy consumption and domestic energy prices) are provided for that same base year. The exercise focuses on testing emissions projections, and hence not all features of CPAT are used.</p>
<p>The analysis covers annual data from 2000 to 2017, and assumes that consumption of a fuel in a given sector is a function of sector-specific fuel prices and overall level of economic activity, as measure by the GDP. Default settings and no-policy interventions are used for simulations.</p>
<p>The exercise consists of projecting key modeled variables and comparing those simulations with observed information. The checks are done on a country level basis, with a subset of those being presented here as a sample of results. Results are presented by means of figures, and tables of key statistics, namely the Root Mean Square error (RMSE) and its normalized version.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>For the selection of countries, CPAT has been able to capture the global trend in emissions. However, there are periods where the volatility of projections is larger than that of observed data, and where local trends, and in particular levels, are not properly captured. For a fixed set of elasticities, this gaps with respect to observed historical information can result from projected prices showing higher volatility than observed ones. This is explored in a subsequent stage.</p>

<p>CPAT shows a good performance on projecting the trend of emissions in most tested countries. A deeper look at the vertical axis’ scale of each plot will show periods of increasing gaps between projected and observed emissions. For a given set of price elasticities of demand, this could be explained by an inverse gap in projected versus observed domestic prices.</p>

<p>CPAT is an elasticity-based model where Emissions depend on fossil fuel consumptions, which in turn depend on fuel prices. It follows that, given the negative price elasticity of demand, an over-estimation (under-estimation) of prices with respect to the ones observed in reality, may lead to an under-estimation (over-estimation) of energy consumption, and hence emissions. The case of China, is a clear example of this. Projected prices are below observed historical ones. Since elasticities were computed based on historical prices, this results in higher hindcasted emissions than observed.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the case of the UK escapes this explanation. The hindcasting tool projects lower emissions despite the lower modeled domestic prices. This gap in projected emissions would be amplified if considering in the model the policies that the UK implemented in the mid 2010s. These discrepancies remain for further analysis.</p>
<p>The tracking of historical information by the simulations may also be improved when setting short and long-term elasticities to model the energy consumption behavior. The current exercise only considers the former, and leaves the latter for further research.</p>
<p>As an additional remark, by construction, CPAT domestic prices for fossil fuels track international market prices for these fuels, and are adjusted with the help of an historical factor. The factor helps tame the volatility. However, for some countries, domestic observed prices remain smoother than projected ones. This may follow as well from policies like existing price regulations, not modeled in the current runs, and also left for further research.</p>

<p>When considering the coal prices used for the power sector in all countries, it can be seen that CPAT forecasts are, on average, above observed prices. The set of figures below, shows this through the distribution of the relative difference (Projections/Observed), and its concentration under the value of “1”.</p>
<p>A subset of years is taken as a reference, but the behavior is consistent for all years. This reinforces the idea that a second set of price elasticities of demand based on price projections may be needed.</p>

<p>The hindcasting exercise was focused on projecting emissions (GHG and energy-related CO2). It consists of a partial hindcasting, as the international prices used as inputs correspond to the outturn of prices (observed), instead of projections of prices dating from before the base year selected. It can, hence, serve to better study how the forecasting of domestic prices takes place once the true values of some inputs are known.</p>
<p>For the countries analyzed, CPAT generally shows a good performance capturing the historical trends of the respective variables. In most cases, however, the volatility of observed data is not replicated with CPAT projections. Moreover, depending on the country, CPAT’s projections appear to be persistently under (over) estimating values with respect to historical ones. While this may result from the implementation of policies that were not modeled in the exercise, it can also result from discrepancies in price forecasting, and may be subject to additional country-specific adjustments.</p>

<p>The parameter sensitivity analysis explores the sensitivity of a set of selected parameters with regard to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The power sector assumptions;</li>
<li>Macroeconomic adjustments;</li>
<li>Elasticity adjustments; and</li>
<li>Price source adjustments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis aims to propose a classification of the sensitivity of the parameters, i.e.&nbsp;how CPAT behaves when changing the default parameters, and more especially how the change in parameters affects the emissions’ reductions.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.8.6.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology-3"><span class="header-section-number">3.8.6.2</span> Methodology</h4>
<p>In order to test the sensitivity of the parameters, the following steps were performed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Settings</strong>. Default parameters are used for G20 countries and for a carbon tax increasing from 10$ to 75$.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model run</strong>. The MT is run using the same defaults but changing one parameter only.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data</strong>. The database is then compiled, retaining CPAT’s output on emissions for G20 countries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computation</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Change in Emissions: Carbon Tax $75 in 2030 vs Baseline</li>
<li>Relative change (i.e.&nbsp;to the default parameter) in percentage points (pp). The difference between the change of CO2 emissions recorded under the default setting and the change in CO2 emissions under the other options is computed in order to analyse how each option is sensitive to the baseline parameter.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Output</strong>. Create a sensitivity classification of parameters affecting CPAT’s behavior (no sensitivity/negligible/sensitivity/high sensitivity).</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 data-number="3.8.6.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.8.6.3</span> Results</h4>
<p>Based on the methodology described above, the sensitivity of the parameters to CPAT to CO2 emissions varies from <strong>no effect to very sensitive</strong> when focusing on the relative changes (i.e.&nbsp;CO2 emissions reduction relative to the default parameter). The following rule-of-thumb is used to classify the sensitivity of the parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>No effect: no variation</li>
<li>Negligible: less than 2 percentage points</li>
<li>Sensitivity: between 2 and 5 percentage points</li>
<li>High sensitivity: more than 5 percentage points</li>

<p>Energy balances are a key source of information for CPAT. While the model uses energy consumption as a main input for the mitigation module, energy consumption is itself built based on the structure and information provided in the energy balances framework. This document presents the main principles used to transform the energy balances information into a structure consistent with CPAT’s fuels and sectors, as well as the steps taken to build energy consumption tables based on the CPAT energy balances.</p>

<p>Starting from CPAT Prototype version 1.478, we separate biomass to biogasoline, biodiesel and other biofuels.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.9.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cpat-energy-sectors"><span class="header-section-number">3.9.2.2</span> CPAT energy sectors</h4>
<p>The energy sectors in CPAT are based on the IEA Extended Energy Balances dataset. We divide all energy flows into three main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw energy supply,</li>
<li>Energy transformation, and</li>
<li>Final energy consumption.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each country <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, the balancing flow in raw energy supply category is Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES), which should be equal to the sum of Imports, Production, Exports (negative), Stock changes, International marine bunkers (only on the world level) and International aviation bunkers (only on the world level). Stock changes and bunkers were combined in “Stock and bunker changes (STOCKCHA)” flow.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{TPE}S_{j} = \text{Productio}n_{j} + \text{Import}s_{j} - \text{Export}s_{j} + \text{STOCKCH}A_{j}\)</span></p>
<p>Energy transformation category includes the following IEA flows: transformation processes (TOTTRANF, includes electricity generation), transfers (TRANSFER), energy industry own use (OWNUSE), distributional losses (DISTLOSS), and statistical differences (STATDIFF). The balancing equation for total final consumption (TFC) is:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{TF}C_{j} = \text{TPE}S_{j} + \text{TOTTRAN}F_{j} + \text{TRANSFE}R_{j} + \text{OWNUS}E_{j} + \text{DISTLOS}S_{j} + \text{STATDIF}F_{j}\)</span></p>
<p>In transformation processes, we separate the power sector - transformation of fuels into electricity. We include main activity producer electricity plants, autoproducer electricity plants, main activity producer CHP plants, and autoproducer CHP plants. The main sector groups in final energy consumption are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry</li>
<li>Transport</li>
<li>Building</li>
<li>Power sector</li>
</ul>
<p>We disaggregate transport and industry further to sectors.</p>

<p>As the energy balances and prices are the main inputs for the Mitigation module, it is also essential to understand the overlap between energy prices and energy consumption by sector and fuels. The table below depicts the energy consumption table obtained in CPAT following transformations from international sources and CPAT’s own projections. For fossil fuels and electricity we have sector-specific or general energy prices and taxes per energy unit (please see a separate documentation on CPAT Prices and Taxes), for renewables we use price indices instead.</p>

<p>The purpose of this section is to present the sequence of processes applied to build and project Energy Consumption data in CPAT format, that is also sufficiently derived from original international sources. This process is applied as well to build a set of time series of Energy Consumption used for regression analysis and hindcasting.</p>
<p>Raw Inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy Balances (EB) from IEA (yearly information. 2018 and 2019)</li>
<li>Energy Balances (EB) from Enerdata (yearly information. Last update:

<p>Intermediate inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPAT projected Energy Consumption (EC) (2019)</li>
<li>User defined parameters for projections and for EC adjustment</li>
</ul>
<p>Outcome:</p>
<p>Energy Consumption tables created using CPAT own structure, assumptions and projections based on raw data published by international databases. The table below depicts an example structure of such table:</p>

<p>Figure 3‑50: Energy Consumption</p>
<p>The CPAT energy consumption projections for the base year include a sub-process under which the fuel transformation sector is created. In CPAT we transform balances into final energy consumption (buildings, industry, transport, other), power sector (part of energy transformation in balances) and fuel transformation. Fuel Transformation sector is determined by the difference between primary and final energy consumption, subtracting Fuel Transformation in the power sector. Additionally, all oil products plus natural gas are aggregated to avoid dealing with negative fuel consumption.</p>

<p>Energy prices and taxes are among the main inputs of the Mitigation module. They include information on (1) domestic energy prices by fuel and sector, (2) governmental price controls, (3) international energy prices and forecasts, and (4) existing carbon pricing mechanisms (carbon taxes and ETS). This document reflects the main principles and data sources used to build the CPAT Prices and Taxes part of the Mitigation module and information on assumptions used in calculations and the main outputs of the Mitigation module that directly depend on the prices and taxes data.</p>

<p>Figure 3‑52: Mitigation module scheme: prices and taxes</p>
<p>The main data sources for prices and taxes inputs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>For international energy price forecasts: energy price scenarios from the World Bank (Commodity Markets Outlook, “Pink Sheet” data), IMF (World Economy Outlook), IEA (World Energy Outlook), and EIA (International Energy Outlook);</li>
<li>For domestic energy prices and forecasts: historical fuel- and sector-specific prices from Enerdata, IEA, IMF FAD, and other sources;</li>
<li>For current carbon pricing mechanisms: historical and planned carbon taxation or ETS information, mainly based on the Carbon Pricing Dashboard;</li>
<li>For subsidies: IMF Energy Subsidies Template, ODI, other data sources</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the historical data and policy specifications, including sub-sectoral exemptions, the Mitigation module calculates the changes in energy prices and their impact on energy consumption (please see the Mitigation module’s documentation for more details). These energy prices also act as an input for other modules, including the distributional module and the Transport module.</p>
<p>As one of the outputs, the Mitigation module calculates fiscal revenues based on taxation, price controls, and energy consumption data.</p>

<p>Note 2: As discussed before, existing policy coverage for carbon tax and ETS permit prices are fractional, while the coverage for new policies is binary. Indeed, when considering sector and fuel coverage, for existing policies, CPAT accounts for the fraction of the consumption that is affected by the policy.

<p>Figure 3‑67: Main components of baseline prices</p>
<p><strong>Supply cost</strong> is an average price that includes all price components like production and transformation costs, transportation and distribution costs, profits, and others, except taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Retail price</strong> is an average end-user price paid by the final user in the corresponding sector (power generation, industry, transport, residential) per unit of energy, including all applicable taxes and subsidies. According to IEA, the historical retail prices are calculated as a ratio of total sales of energy to the sold volume. The retail price should equal the supply cost plus all relevant taxes:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{tt}x_{\text{cgf},t}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the average retail price, <span class="math inline">\(\text{sp}\)</span> is the price before taxes and <span class="math inline">\(\text{ttx}\)</span> is the total taxes for country <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. This holds for both the baseline and the policy scenarios.</p>
<p>Note: In general, carbon pricing policies and the phasing out of consumer-side subsidies will affect the <span class="math inline">\(\text{ttx}\)</span> component, while the phasing out of existing producer-side subsidies will instead affect the supply cost <span class="math inline">\(\text{sp}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Price gap/total taxes/subsidy</strong>: the gap between the supply cost and retail price. This is a function of any type of taxation and/or subsidization that causes the supply cost to deviate from the import/export parity price plus mark-ups and the any taxes applied to the price before tax, such as VAT, excise taxes, and other taxes (environmental, renewable support taxes, energy security taxes, social taxes, and others). The historical values of <span class="math inline">\(\text{ttx}\)</span> are calculated in the dataset as a difference between average retail price and price before taxes and, thus, are negative in the case of a net subsidy. For forecasted years, the value of <span class="math inline">\(\text{ttx}\)</span> will instead be computed as the sum of the forecasted subcomponents (different types of taxes and consumer-side subsidies).</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{tt}x_{\text{cgf},t} = p_{\text{cgf},t} - sp_{\text{cgf},t}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{ttx}\)</span> stands for the total net taxes (or net subsidy if negative), <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the average retail price and <span class="math inline">\(\text{sp}\)</span> is the supply cost (i.e.&nbsp;the price before tax). By construction, this relationship holds for all scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>VAT payment</strong>: historical values are calculated in the dataset as VAT base (price before tax plus all other taxes except VAT) multiplied by the VAT rate. The VAT rate is assumed to be 0 for industrial and power generation users since these users receive a credit on their input VAT.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{va}t_{c,f,g,t} = \left( sp_{c,f,g,t} + \text{tx}o_{c,f,g,t} \right)*\text{vatrat}e_{c,f,g,t}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{VAT}\)</span> is the VAT payment per energy unit, <span class="math inline">\(\text{txo}\)</span> represents the excise and other taxes/subsidies and <span class="math inline">\(\text{VATrate}\)</span> is the VAT rate.</p>
<p><strong>Excise and other taxes</strong>: calculated in the historical dataset as a difference between retail price, supply cost, and VAT payment.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{tx}o_{\text{cgf},t} = p_{\text{cgf},t} - sp_{\text{cgf},t} - \text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t}\)</span></p>
<p>For the forecasted years, instead, it is computed as the sum of its projected components. This, as in the scenarios we decompose the Excise and other taxes category to several additional price components, such as <em>current carbon tax, current ETS permit price, new policy, new excise tax (if applicable), and fixed/ad-valorem part / other, which includes price controls (if applicable)</em>.</p>
<p>These categories (except new policy and new excise tax), being the Excise and other taxes category components, do not affect the retail price.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon tax/ETS permit price: ‘effective’ carbon tax/ETS permit price as a component of total taxes is calculated separately in CPAT based on existing carbon pricing mechanisms and emission factors. Details are provided below.</li>
<li>New policy/new excise tax: the main driver of the change in retail prices. They are calculated as components of the excise and other categories, depending on the chosen policy (new carbon tax, ETS, road fuel tax, others) and emission factors. By default, in the baseline scenario, new policy/new excise taxes are equal to zero.</li>
<li>Subsidies: per unit of energy subsidy is calculated as a sum of all subsidies over the total final consumption by sectors (power, industry, residential, transport). The details are provided below.</li>

<p>For years starting from 2021, the price components are modeled by following rules.</p>
<p><strong>Retail price</strong> for fuel f in sector s in year t is a sum of the supply cost and all applicable taxes (VAT payment, excise and other taxes):</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{tx}o_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Supply cost</strong> for fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is calculated using a coefficient of supply costs to base years (2017-2019) to the global prices in the same period, multiplied by the respective international fuel price in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(sp_{\text{cgf},t} = \frac{sp_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{gp_{f,t_{0}}}*gp_{\text{cf},t}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(sp_{\text{cgf},t}\)</span> denotes the average supply costs for country <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, fuel <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in sector <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in base years <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(gp_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}\)</span> is the average global fuel price in base years, <span class="math inline">\(gp_{\text{cf},t}\)</span> – global fuel price based on the chosen international energy price forecast in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Notice that the global price for certain fuels change from country to country, as the reference market differs.</p>
<p><strong>Producer-side fossil fuel subsidy</strong> is equal to the previous year’s per unit of energy producer-side fossil fuel subsidy unless the user decides to phase out fossil fuels.</p>
<p><strong>VAT payment</strong> equals the previous year’s VAT payment ratio to the supply cost multiplied by the current year’s supply cost:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t} = \frac{\text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\text{cgf},t}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Excise and other taxes</strong> components are decomposed into five categories: current carbon tax, current ETS permit price, new policy component, new excise tax, and fixed/ad-valorem part/other taxes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Current carbon tax and ETS permit price: if the user decides to apply existing carbon pricing mechanisms, the values will be calculated based on historical values and planned policies. If a country’s carbon pricing policy is not specified for years after 2020, the current carbon tax / ETS permit price per energy unit, <span class="math inline">\(\text{xcp}\)</span>, is calculated as:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{xc}p_{\text{cgf},t} = \text{xc}t_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{xets}p_{\text{cgf},t}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(= \text{xc}t_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}*\left( 1 + \delta_{\text{CT}} \right)^{t - t0} + \text{xets}p_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}*\left( 1 + \delta_{\text{ETS}} \right)^{t - t_{0}}\)</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>As show above, the existing carbon price per energy unit results from scaling the existing carbon taxes and ETS permit prices from the base year, <span class="math inline">\(\text{XCT}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{XETSP}\)</span> respectively, by their specific coverage <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>, the fuel-sector-specific emissions factor <span class="math inline">\(\text{ef}\)</span>, and the user-defined growth rate of the nation-wide price for the forecasted years <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{nc}p_{\text{cgf},t} = \text{nc}t_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{nets}p_{\text{cgf},t} = \text{NC}T_{c,t}*ef_{\text{cgf}}*\varphi_{\text{NCT},\text{cgf},t} + \text{NETS}P_{c,t}*ef_{\text{cgf}}*\varphi_{\text{NETS},\text{cgf},t}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{nc}t_{\text{cgf},t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{nets}p_{\text{cgf},t}\)</span> stand for the new carbon tax per energy unit and the new ETS price per energy unit, respectively.

<p>Among the options available, the user can select the sectors or fuel that will be exempt of the policy implemented, as well as the linear phase out of those exemptions, if selected by the user. This is already considered in the sector-fuel coverage <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New excise tax</strong>: the user can specify additional per energy unit excise tax in the “Manual inputs” tab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed/ad-valorem part/other</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the country’s taxation regime is “fixed,” this category equals the previous year’s absolute value of the price gap not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax and VAT payment, corrected to price controls.</p></li>
<li><p>If the taxation regime in the country is “ad-valorem,” this category is equal to the ratio of the previous year’s part of the price gap not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax and VAT payment to the supply cost, multiplied by the current year’s supply cost, corrected to price controls.</p></li>

<p>When simulating the introduction of a new ETS permit, CPAT allows the user to define, among others, the year of implementation, the initial price/tax to be considered, and the level at which it should reach in a ‘target’ year. While still on a development phase, CPAT incorporates a ‘goal seek’ feature to help the user determine the new policy’s target price based on an goal on the emissions level.</p>
<p><img src="03/media/image100.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Figure 3‑68: ETS target price - Goal Seek</p>
<p>Located to the right of the Advanced Options in the dashboard, the goal seek allows the user to input:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The sectoral inclusion</p></li>
<li><p>The proportion of the industrial sector to be covered (if Industry is included)</p></li>
<li><p>The emissions target (in absolute terms, or the reduction percentage)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The lower part of the goal seek shows the emissions, by sector, for the baseline and the policy. The ‘Total’ row shows, first, the aggregated emissions (considering only the sectors included by the user), second, the emissions goal, and third, the squared difference of emissions between the baseline and the policy scenario.</p>
<p>While the user can apply the goal seek functionality in Excel, the algortihm is not particularly useful in this case, and it is more convenient to test the different target prices manually, step-by-step.</p>
<p>In brief, once the inputs of the Goal Seek feature are provided, the user should check different alternatives of a target price and evaluate how emissions perform under each one. This simplified tool aims at giving a broad approximation of the price level required to achieve the emissions goal for the target year.</p>

The harmonized calculations would imply a high burden on energy sector to achieve NDC goals. However, the user should also consider measures that the country would take in other sectors (agriculture, forestry, land use, sectoral policies) to achieve NDC goals.</p>

<p>This table presents CPAT four key components (‘Modules’) and their corresponding codes.</p>
<p>• Mitigation module – a reduced form energy model for projecting emissions and estimating impacts of pricing and other mitigation instruments on energy consumption, prices, GHG and local air pollutant emissions, revenues, GDP, and abatement</p>
<p>• Air pollution module – a reduced form air pollution and health model for estimating impacts on premature deaths and disease for local air pollutants like PM2.5 and ozone;</p>
<p>• Distributional module – a cost-push model for estimating impacts of changes in energy prices on industries and households (by income decile and region), including recycling of revenues from mitigation policy.</p>
<p>• Transportation module – a reduced form model for estimating the impacts of motor fuel price changes on congestion and road fatalities.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The mitigation chapter of the CPAT documentation was prepared by Alexandra Campmas, Daniel Bastidas, Olivier Lelouch, Faustyna Gawryluk, Paolo Agnolucci, and Stephen Stretton. Some sections are based on earlier papers by Ian Parry, Simon Black, Karlygash Zhunussova, Nate Vernon, Alexandra Campmas, and Stephen Stretton. Thanks to the whole CPAT team – and, in particular, to Simon Black, Karlygash Zhunussova, Paulina Schulz Antipa, and Samuel Okullo for useful comments, clarifications, and assistance in preparing this paper. CPAT has benefited from the extremely helpful comments of our initial reviewers in early 2021 including, among others, Charl Jooste and Claire Nicolas; thanks also to Claire and Adam Suski for providing EPM comparison data. CPAT relies on the assistance of many parties for data and support, including other WB Global Practices (including Phillip Hannam from Energy GP, who helped develop the techno-economic power model) and other academic groups, including IIASA (who provided emissions factors). Thanks to Dirk Heine, Stephane Hallegatte, Simon Black, and Ian Parry for leadership and direction, and for originating what became CPAT.
