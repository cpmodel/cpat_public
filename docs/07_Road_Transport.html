<p>Carbon taxes impact fuel prices and thereby shape driving behavior. In particular, carbon taxes increase incentives to substitute away from private vehicles towards more fuel-efficient means of transport. As road traffic has many externalities aside carbon emissions, carbon taxes may lead to a reduction in road transport-related externalities such as congestion, accidents and road damage. To estimate the magnitude of these co-benefits, the CPAT Road Transport Module quantifies the effect of a user-defined carbon tax or road fuel tax on (a) the intensity of congestion as measured by the time lost relative to free-flowing traffic, (b) the number of road fatalities, and (c) the maintenance cost due to road damage.</p>
<p>The Road Transport Module is based on elasticities that we estimate using an international country-year level dataset. This dataset is compiled from many sources and describes road transport, as well as general demographics and economic variables. The dataset covers the time from 1994 to 2021 and 186 countries, so that we can use within-country and between-country variation for identification. We estimate elasticities with respect to fuel prices and with respect to fuel taxes, as well as short and long-run elasticities. We estimate country-specific elasticities based on global coefficients and country-specific covariates.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the resulting elasticities are broadly in line with the literature: for a 10% fuel price increase from a carbon tax, total vehicle-km traveled decrease in the short run on average by 2.8 %; congestion levels decrease by 3.4 %; accident fatalities decrease by 6.1 %; and road damage decreases by 4.4 % in the long run.</p>
<p>The estimated elasticities are used within CPAT to produce policy forecasts of total vehicle-km traveled, congestion levels, accident fatalities and road damage cost. By choosing a country and inputting different parameters for a policy in the dashboard, the user obtains a series of graphs showing the time series with and without the policy, as well as the policy impact defined by the difference of the two time series.</p>
<p>Important caveats of the CPAT Road Transport Module include the assumed linearity of effects, which may potentially not apply to large policy changes. Moreover, econometrically estimated elasticities take the historic capital stock as given and do not predict the impact of disruptive technological changes such as electric vehicles (EVs). Finally, CPAT does not measure the externality cost of non-realized trips.</p>

<p>Aside carbon emissions, road transport causes various externalities. The most important transport externalities examined here are congestion, road damage and accidents. These externalities are not the explicit target of carbon taxes, but also decline when the total distance traveled declines. Such reductions in externalities occur as a “side effect” to the direct goal of a carbon tax and are commonly called <em>co-benefits</em> (I. Parry et al., 2014b).</p>
<p>As a tool for assessing the overall impact of carbon tax reforms across the globe, CPAT predicts the magnitude of these co-benefits, among others for the transport sector. The methodology relies on econometric estimations of long-run and short-run elasticities of externalities with respect to fuel prices. The fuel price change induced by a carbon tax is then multiplied by the elasticities to predict the transport co-benefits of the carbon tax policy.</p>
<p>The following sections will first give an overview over the relevant literature; then present the data sources used and explain the methodology for estimating the elasticities of externalities with respect to fuel prices. In a next section, we will present the estimation results on three transport externalities: congestion, road damage and accidents. Finally, we present the Excel implementation of this work in CPAT.</p>

<p>We do not consider VKT (analogous to the US American vehicle-miles traveled, VMT) a policy target <em>per se</em> but include it in order to illustrate one of the main channels through which fuel prices affect congestion, road damage and accidents. Reductions in VKT may be a result of people transitioning to less transport-intensive activities, other transport modes, in particular public/collective transport options, closer workplaces and residence location choice (Molloy &amp; Shan, 2013).</p>
<p>In particular, a carbon tax may incite passengers to travel together, such that a reduction of vehicle-km may be achieved <em>without</em> a reduction in passenger-trips, by increasing the rate of passengers per vehicle. Bento et al.&nbsp;(2013) show that the average number of users increases with fuel prices, because users carpool (i.e.&nbsp;share a vehicle) more. Carbon taxes may also deter detours, so that vehicle-km, and even passenger-km, may be reduced without a reduction in passenger-trips.</p>

<p>Note: Channels (in orange boxes) are shown to illustrate the economic theory; they are not modeled/estimated separately within CPAT.</p>
<p>The negative relationship between fuel prices and VKT is well established in the economics literature. The literature provides a large number of empirical estimates of the elasticity of VKT wrt fuel prices. Table 7‑1 lists a selection of these estimates: most commonly, the estimates of VKT elasticity range from -0.05 to -0.50. A review paper found the mean estimate to be -0.10 in the short run and -0.29 in the long run (Goodwin et al., 2004).</p>
<p>Some of these responses take time, so the long-run gasoline price elasticity of road deaths is likely to exceed the short-run elasticity. However, high fuel prices also push consumers to invest into more fuel-efficient vehicles, either buying cars that are more efficient or switching from cars to motorcycles (or other modes). In this case, the literature has extensively discussed the importance of the <em>rebound effect</em>, defined as efficiency induced consumption or, more plainly, the idea “buy a more fuel-efficient car, drive more” (Gillingham, Rapson, et al., 2015). The rebound effect might cause long-run VKT elasticity to be <em>lower</em> than short-run VKT elasticity.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="congestion"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.2</span> Congestion</h3>
<p>Congestion is the result of interaction between the limited vehicle capacity of a given facility and the demands for space by individual users. The costs of congestion occur in the form of excess travel time, increased expected damage and injury from accidents among vehicles, and additional vehicle operating costs for wear and fuel (Murphy &amp; Delucchi, 1997).</p>
<p>The relationship of total VKT to congestion is straightforward: the less vehicles on the road, the smaller the congestion problem (Sugiyama et al., 2008). This theoretical relationship has been documented in the literature for decades (Johnson, 1964). When people share vehicles (carpooling) or substitute to public transport, the reduction in congestion may be achieved with constant total passenger-km (Bento et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Figure 7‑2 – Schematic representation of the link between carbon tax and congestion</p>
<p><img src="./07/media/image2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note: Channels (in blue boxes) are shown to illustrate the economic theory; they are not modeled/estimated separately within CPAT.</p>
<p>Empirically, congestion has been difficult to measure until very recently. Conventional measurement methods are costly, such as employing humans to count, establishing cameras or installing wires on the road. The resulting measurements only cover a limited number of precise locations and often only short periods of time. More recently, the development of mobile communication technology has allowed newer measures such as the congestion indicators of Waze, Google Maps, Inrix and TomTom. These GPS-based data cover larger areas over long periods of time and are highly disaggregated.</p>
<p>Given the limited/recent availability of congestion data, the empirical literature on the impact of fuel prices on congestion levels is relatively scarce. Burger &amp; Kaffine (2009) find that a USD 1 increase in fuel prices reduces congestion and raises average freeway speeds by approximately 7% during rush-hour periods. They estimate short-run elasticity with a methodology similar to ours and find estimates ranging from -0.12 to -0.29. In an older study, C. A. Dahl (1979) finds an estimate of -0.35 for the elasticity of speed wrt fuel price. Cohen &amp; Roth (2017) find that higher diesel prices lead to less but heavier trucks on the road, thereby reducing congestion.</p>
<p>Burke et al.&nbsp;(2017) examine the reaction to a fuel tax reform in Indonesia and find a fuel price elasticity of motor vehicle flows (number of vehicles on toll roads) between –0.1 and –0.2. They estimate that Indonesia’s fuel subsidy reforms of 2013 and 2014 have reduced traffic pressure by around 10%, relative to the counterfactual without reform.</p>
<p>The externality cost of congestion can be measured in monetary equivalent by multiplying time lost in traffic congestion by the value of travel time (Abrantes &amp; Wardman, 2011).</p>

<section id="road-accident-fatalities" class="level3" data-number="7.3.3">
<h3 data-number="7.3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="road-accident-fatalities"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.3</span> Road accident fatalities</h3>
<p>Road traffic injury is now the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 years. It is the eighth leading cause of death for all age groups surpassing HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and diarrheal diseases (World Health Organization, 2018c).</p>
<p>Road accidents are a function of factors including road user behavior, road characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and the distances driven (vehicle-kilometers traveled, VKT) on roads by different types of drivers. Research has also shown that economic variables affect road accident risk exposure. Among these, fuel prices and key macroeconomic measures such as the unemployment rate have been the focus of prior studies rates (Ahangari et al., 2014; Gerdtham &amp; Ruhm, 2006; International Transport Forum, 2015). The negative effect of fuel prices on the risk of fatal accidents is well established in the literature.</p>
<p>For international comparisons, the literature considers data on fatalities more reliable than data on the number of accidents and number of injuries (Luoma &amp; Sivak, 2007; Sauerzapf et al., 2010; World Health Organization, 2013). This is why most studies concentrate on deadly crashes, when trying to assess the relationship of fuel prices and road accidents. Chi et al.&nbsp;(2010) is a notable exception to this rule.</p>
<p>The relationship from fuel prices (and thus taxes) to accidents is multifactorial, as shown in Chi, Porter, et al.&nbsp;(2013). Several aspects may be summarized to a principal channel which is VKT. Reduced driving decreases the exposure of both vehicle occupants and others to road crashes.</p>
<p>Figure 7‑3 – Schematic representation of the link between carbon tax and accidents, adapted from Chi, Porter et al.&nbsp;(2013)</p>
<p><img src="./07/media/image3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Note: Channels (in red boxes) are shown to illustrate the economic theory; they are not modeled/estimated separately within CPAT.</p>
<p>In addition to reducing VKT, higher gasoline prices might also lead to a reduction in road deaths per kilometer driven. One reason is that, to conserve fuel, drivers might reduce high-speed driving and so-called “aggressive driving” (high rates of acceleration and braking). Another reason is that high-risk drivers, including the young, the old, and those taking leisure-related trips, are particularly sensitive to gasoline prices (Morrisey &amp; Grabowski, 2011; Sivak, 2009). Higher gasoline prices also result in substitution from heavier to lighter, more fuel-efficient cars, which are associated with a lower overall number of road deaths per kilometer traveled (Gayer, 2004; White, 2004). Substitution to bus travel may also reduce overall road safety risks.</p>
<p>However, through other channels higher gasoline prices might actually lead to <em>more</em> rather than fewer road deaths. Higher gasoline prices reduce congestion and thereby increase average speed (Burger and Kaffine 2009), which increases the risk of fatal crashes. Fuel price-induced substitution to motorcycles, which are more fuel-efficient, may also cause additional road deaths (Hyatt et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2009). In particular, substitution to lighter cars and motorcycles would explain why long-run elasticities of accidents wrt fuel prices would be <em>smaller</em> in absolute magnitude than short-run elasticities.</p>
<p>Many studies in this field concentrate on the United States. Some authors argue that the effect of higher gasoline prices on road deaths operates via a reduction in VKT (Grabowski &amp; Morrisey, 2004), whereas others report also a reduction in road deaths per VKT (Chi et al., 2010; Chi, Quddus, et al., 2013; Grabowski &amp; Morrisey, 2006; Haughton &amp; Sarkar, 1996; Montour, 2011; Sivak, 2009). Sivak (2009) explains this reduction by the disproportionate reduction in leisure driving (riskier than commuter driving) and rural driving (more risky than urban driving).</p>
<p>Leigh &amp; Wilkinson (1991) examine the relationship between gas price, gas tax, and road fatalities for all 50 states using a multiple regression framework. They find that a 1% increase in gas tax leads to a 0.18% to 0.20% reduction in road fatalities, but that gas prices are not statistically significant in explaining road fatalities. They use a different method, using cent-per-gallon rather than a log-log specification as does this study. A later study by Grabowski &amp; Morrisey (2004), using 1983 to 2000 state-level data and a panel model to investigate the relationship between gas prices and road fatalities, finds that a 1% increase in gasoline prices reduces road fatalities by 0.23%. Looking only at Mississippi, Chi et al., (2010) finds a short-run elasticity of -0.25 and a long-run elasticity of -0.47. For Minnesota, Chi, Quddus, et al.&nbsp;(2013) find an elasticity of -0.219 for fatal crashes wrt to fuel prices and their estimates are higher in rural areas than in urban areas.</p>
<p>In an international study, Burke &amp; Nishitateno (2015) find a 1% increase in the gasoline pump price would reduce road fatalities by 0.3% to 0.6%. Around 35,000 road deaths per year could be avoided by the removal of global fuel subsidies. Litman (2012) presents a scatterplot for 16 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries that shows a negative association between average gasoline prices and traffic fatality rates. Using a panel model of 16 industrialized countries, Ahangari et al.&nbsp;(2014) find an elasticity of -0.22 after controlling for VKT.</p>
<p>Other country-specific short-term elasticity estimates include -0.2 to -0.3 for New Zealand (Best &amp; Burke, 2019) and -0.2 for Australia (Burke &amp; Teame, 2018).</p>
<p>In a dynamic urban model, Avner et al.&nbsp;(2014) examine the impact of carbon taxes on urban mobility and underline the lock-in effect from public transport investments: while the quality of urban transport infrastructure is difficult to capture quantitatively, we include data on satisfaction with public transport in our elasticity estimation to account for this effect.</p>

<section id="road-damage" class="level3" data-number="7.3.4">
<h3 data-number="7.3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="road-damage"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.4</span> Road damage</h3>
<p>Road damage depends strongly on road usage (Jacobson &amp; Wågberg, 2005), but not all vehicles affect road damage equally: wear and tear on the pavement is a rapidly rising function of a vehicle’s axle weight (Jacobson &amp; Wågberg, 2005; Murphy &amp; Delucchi, 1997; Parker &amp; Hussain Ph D, 2006; US FHWA, 2000). Estimations suggest that the pavement wear and tear of one average five-axle truck equates to approximately 4,000 cars (National Center for Freight &amp; Infrastructure, 2014). Therefore, nearly all of the vehicle-caused road damage is attributable to heavy-duty vehicles (trucks).</p>
<p>In most countries around the world,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> light-duty vehicles (cars) use gasoline and trucks use diesel. Road damage is thus more dependent on diesel price than on gasoline price.</p>
<p>The externality cost of road transport from pavement wear and tear has been discussed extensively in the economics literature, going back as far as Adam Smith (Lindsey, 2006). There is a consensus that diesel is strongly under-taxed, when comparing tax level to externality cost (I. W. H. Parry, 2008; Santos, 2017).</p>
<p>Many authors have suggested addressing it directly through different forms of road pricing explicitly indexed on road damage cost (e.g. Newbery, 1988; Parker &amp; Hussain Ph D, 2006; Santos et al., 2010). From an economist’s point of view, addressing the externality explicitly, with taxes mirroring the externality cost directly, is the first best solution. However, as a carbon tax also increases diesel prices, it decreases truck VKT and thereby reduces road damage (Barla et al., 2014; Wadud, 2016). In general, a carbon tax reduces all road transport externalities that depend on VKT (Ekins, 1996).</p>
<p>The strength of this co-benefit depends on the elasticity of truck VKT with respect to fuel prices/taxes. There is large evidence that trucks reduce their VKT when fuel prices rise. Let us cite just a few recent studies finding significantly elastic VKT for trucks: Barla et al. (2014) find short and long-run price elasticities of -0.43 and -0.80 respectively; He (2015) estimates a VKT elasticity of -0.54; Ramli &amp; Graham (2014) estimate short-run price elasticity between -0.11 and -0.16, long-run elasticity between -0.21 and -0.30 for trucks; Leard et al.&nbsp;(2015) find estimates around -0.20.</p>
<p>Some studies find that the elasticity depends on the type of trucks: Wadud (2016) finds that rigid trucks show statistically significant price elasticity, but articulated trucks do not respond to changes in fuel prices.</p>
<p>On the opposite, some authors find that trucks are relatively inelastic with regards to fuel prices (Winebrake et al., 2015). One study finds that higher diesel prices are associated with fewer but heavier trucks, and therefore <em>more</em> road damage (Cohen &amp; Roth, 2017).</p>
<p>In practice, two cost components to road damage may arise: the cost of repairing the pavement damage, and the additional cost to users, which result from traveling on damaged roadways. Given the difficulty to measure the second component, we concentrate on the first component in CPAT.</p>
<p>Methodologically, it is important to note that some countries earmark revenues from fuel taxes or road charges for road maintenance (Gultom et al., 2017). In these countries, our estimation technique is not valid because of endogeneity, so that we exclude them.</p>
<p>Quantitatively, road damage may be considered the smallest of the three transport externalities considered here.</p>

<p>Regarding the within-country heterogeneity of the effect of fuel price on VKT, the literature has not reached a consensus. Within countries, Bastian &amp; Börjesson (2014) find that urban populations, in particular those with low incomes, respond stronger to fuel price increases and economic downturn, i.e.&nbsp;are reducing car travel more. Similarly, many studies find that (absolute) elasticity diminishes with higher income levels (Santos &amp; Catchesides, 2005; Small &amp; Van Dender, 2007; West, 2004). On the opposite, Wang &amp; Chen (2014) find that higher income households show greater fuel price elasticity than lower income households.</p>
<p>Regarding the effect of fuel prices on accident fatalities, the literature suggest that the poor are more often victims of road accidents because of the vehicles they travel in. There is evidence that larger vehicles (in particular light trucks and SUVs) cause more fatalities than light passenger vehicles, while drivers of SUVs are relatively more protected: (White, 2004) calls this disequilibrium “the ‘Arms race’ on American roads”. The highest risk is borne by motorcyclists who tend to have lower incomes than four-wheeled vehicle drivers (Hyatt et al., 2009). A particular group at high risk for road death are young drivers (aged 15–24) and their passengers. As these drivers are more sensitive to fuel prices, the young drivers accident rate responds particularly strongly to fuel price increases (Morrisey &amp; Grabowski, 2011). One of the few studies looking at gender and race, Chi et al.&nbsp;(2010) find that fuel prices affect accident rates similarly for men and women, as well as for white and black population.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.3.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="between-country-heterogeneity"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.6</span> Between-country heterogeneity</h3>
<p>Regarding the between-country heterogeneity of the effect of fuel prices on VKT, most estimates concentrate on developed countries, in particular the USA. Studies on developing countries often face data challenges, but so far the literature suggests that the elasticities lay within the same order of magnitude in developed and developing countries (Gillingham, Rapson, et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Regarding the effect of fuel prices on accident fatalities, some studies look at differences between high- and low-income countries, but the literature on within-country determinants of road fatalities and their elasticity wrt to fuel prices is scarce. Data is notoriously more scarce in developing countries. Country-level panel data identification strategies such as used in Burke &amp; Nishitateno (2015) typically yield one elasticity for all countries. A priori, the effect is unclear: wealthier individuals travel larger distances and thus have a higher risk of traffic accidents, but poorer individuals travel more on foot and on motorcycles, which increases their risk to die from a road accident.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.3.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fuel-prices-vs.-taxes"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.7</span> Fuel prices vs.&nbsp;taxes</h3>
<p>Most of the above mentioned literature examines the effect of fuel prices on the various outcomes discussed. However, for CPAT we are interested in the effect of a carbon tax.</p>
<p>Regarding the effect on VKT, S. Li et al.&nbsp;(2014) show that gasoline consumption responds more strongly to gasoline taxes than to gasoline prices. They explain that consumers may respond more to taxes than equal-sized changes in tax-inclusive gasoline prices because of perceived persistence and salience. Variation in gasoline taxes also is covered much more intensively in the media.</p>
<p>Regarding road fatalities, Leigh &amp; Wilkinson (1991) show that gasoline taxes have a significant effect on fatalities while the effect of price effect from oil market fluctuations is not significant. However, these findings are on a cents-per-liter basis rather than a percent basis, so they are not directly comparable to our results.</p>

<section id="methodology" class="level3" data-number="7.3.8">
<h3 data-number="7.3.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.8</span> Methodology</h3>
<p>Literature generally finds that the short-term elasticity of fuel use is weaker than the long-term elasticity wrt fuel prices (Chi et al., 2010). Usually, researchers explain this finding by structural adjustments to the vehicle fleet, travel demand (work and residence locations) and infrastructure. Hence, there has been some methodological effort to estimate short-run and long-run elasticities separately.</p>
<p>The methodology for elasticity estimation in the Road Transport Module is similar to Burke &amp; Nishitateno (2015). Using country-year-level data, the main estimations are fixed effects and between estimators of a linear log-log equation. The between estimator uses average data for each country and provides estimates of long-run effects (Baltagi, 2008; Baltagi &amp; Griffin, 1984; Pesaran &amp; Smith, 1995; Pirotte, 1999; Stern, 2010). Fixed-effects estimations control for time-invariant factors such as the extent of mountainous terrain, but when a static fixed-effects equation is estimated the coefficients represent short-run effects. This method has been widely used in the literature looking at the effect of fuel prices on road safety (Best &amp; Burke, 2019; Burke &amp; Nishitateno, 2015; Grabowski &amp; Morrisey, 2006; Montour, 2011). An alternative way of estimating long-run elasticities is the distributed lag specification (Burke &amp; Nishitateno, 2015; Chi, Porter, et al., 2013; Montour, 2011).</p>
<p>Other studies, e.g.&nbsp;Chi, Quddus, et al.&nbsp;(2013), use more time-series related methods, in particular testing for unit roots and accounting for stationarity. These methods are difficult to implement with unbalanced panels, as in our case. However, in his standard econometrics textbook (Baltagi, 2008; Baltagi &amp; Griffin, 1984) considers that time-series methods should apply when T (the number of periods) is large and N (the number of countries) is small, whereas&nbsp;panel data methods like the between estimator are appropriate when T small and N large: “Using panel data, one can avoid the problem of spurious regression<span class="math inline">\(…\)</span>. Unlike the single time series spurious regression literature, the panel data spurious regression estimates give a consistent estimate of the true value of the parameter as both N and T tend to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. This is because, the panel estimator averages across individuals and the information in the independent cross-section data in the panel leads to a stronger overall signal than the pure time series case.”</p>

<h3 data-number="7.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="congestion-1"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.2</span> Congestion</h3>
<p>Traffic congestion is measured using the TomTom Traffic Index. This index covers over 400 cities across 61 countries. The TomTom Traffic index statistics are calculated from anonymized GPS data collected via navigation devices, in-dashboard systems and smartphones.</p>
<p>The congestion level percentages represent the measured amount of extra travel time experienced by drivers across the entire year. As a first step, TomTom establishes a baseline of travel times during uncongested, free flow conditions across each road segment in each city. They then analyze travel times across the entire year for each city. The TomTom Traffic Index then represents the difference between observed travel times and free flow travel time.</p>
<p>For example, an overall congestion level of 36% means that the extra travel time is 36% more than an average trip would take during uncongested conditions. Average times are of actual taken trips, across every vehicle in the entire network, 24/7. Travel times in free-flow (uncongested) conditions are not based on legal speed limits but on actual trips made.</p>
<p>The TomTom Traffic Index is available both overall, as well as for specific weekdays and peak times, including morning and evening peak hours.</p>

<p>In combining these different data sources, the following order of steps is applied:</p>

<p>Aside the final retail price at the pump, we use data on taxes summarizing VAT, existing carbon taxes, excise tax and others.

<p>The benefits of prevented mortalities can be expressed in terms of a “Value of a Statistical Life” (VSL), which represents the value a given population places <em>ex ante</em> on avoiding the death of an unidentified individual. VSL is based on the sum of money each individual is prepared to pay for a given reduction in the risk of premature death, for example from diseases linked to air pollution (OECD, 2012).</p>
<p>The country-specific VSL in CPAT is adapted from OECD (2012), adjusted for GDP growth and inflation (within the Air Pollution Module).</p>
<p>We compute the average speed from TomTom’s total VKT and total travel time. We then compute the VKT per capita from WRS’ national VKT divided by the population size from the WB’s World Development Indicators (WDI). This average VKT per capita is multiplied by the size of urban population over 15 year of age (WDI) and divided by the average speed, yielding total urban travel time.</p>
<p>The total urban travel time is then multiplied by 80% of the average hourly after-tax wages (from Air Pollution Module), yielding the value of travel time.</p>

<p>After establishing this mix of data sources, a visual control of country-specific time series is performed to identify outliers. For each visually identified outlier, we perform thorough background checks and in case of doubt only keep one source (resulting in some limited data loss).</p>

<p>We regress the logarithm of the outcome variable onto a constant, the logarithm of fuel prices, a list of covariates and fixed effects. The general form of the estimated regression estimation is</p>
<p>&nbsp;| | |<br>
&nbsp;| ——————————————————————————————————————————————————- | — |<br>
&nbsp;| <span class="math inline">\(\ln\left( Y_{\text{ct}} \right) = \alpha + \beta\ln\left( p_{\text{ct}} \right) + \gamma\ X_{\text{ct}} + \mu_{t} + \mu_{c} + \epsilon_{\text{ct}}\)</span>, | (1) |</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\ln\left( Y_{\text{ct}} \right)\)</span> is the natural logarithm of the outcome in country <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ln{(p_{\text{ct}})}\)</span> is the natural logarithm of pump price for gasoline, <span class="math inline">\(X_{\text{ct}}\)</span> is a vector of covariates including income per capita and population density, and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{c}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{t}\)</span> are country- and year-specific effects.</p>
<p>An elasticity measures how much an outcome changes relatively to its initial value (e.g.&nbsp;in percent) when another variable, here the pump price of gasoline, changes (in percent).

<h3 data-number="7.5.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="short-run-and-long-run-estimators"><span class="header-section-number">7.5.2</span> Short-run and long-run estimators</h3>
<p>Following (Burke &amp; Nishitateno, 2015), we consider that the within estimator from a static fixed-effects equation represents shorter-run effects, and the between estimator provides estimates of long-run effects (Baltagi, 2008; Baltagi &amp; Griffin, 1984; Pesaran &amp; Smith, 1995; Pirotte, 1999; Stern, 2010).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>For simplicity, let us reduce the notation of the previous equation (1) to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;| | |<br>
&nbsp;| ———————————————————————————- | — |<br>
&nbsp;| <span class="math inline">\(y_{\text{ct}} = \alpha + \beta x_{\text{ct}} + \mu_{c} + \epsilon_{\text{ct}}\)</span>, | (2) |</p>
<p>where the logarithms have been omitted and all righthand-side variables summarized under the vector <span class="math inline">\(x_{\text{ct}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The interpretation for the long and short run is based on the idea that the previous equation (2) may alternatively be formulated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;| | |<br>
&nbsp;| ————————————————————————————————————————————- | — |<br>
&nbsp;| <span class="math inline">\(y_{\text{ct}} = \alpha + \beta'{\overline{x}}_{c} + \beta''(x_{\text{ct}} - {\overline{x}}_{c}) + \mu_{c} + \epsilon_{\text{ct}}\)</span>, | (3) |</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\({\overline{x}}_{c}\)</span> is the average of <span class="math inline">\(x_{\text{ct}}\)</span> over time: <span class="math inline">\({\overline{x}}_{c} = \sum_{t}^{}{x_{\text{ct}}/T_{c}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}\)</span> is the number of years included for country <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in the regression.</p>
<p>In the model described by equation (3), we postulate that changes in the average value of <span class="math inline">\(x_{\text{ct}}\)</span> for an individual country may have a different effect from temporary departures from the average. The model allows a different response to permanent rather than transitory changes. If <span class="math inline">\(\beta' = \beta''\)</span>, then the model in (3) collapses into the previous model in (2).</p>
<p>Whatever the properties of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{c}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\text{ct}}\)</span>, if equation (2) is true, we can take the averages and find that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;| | |<br>
&nbsp;| ————————————————————————————————- | — |<br>
&nbsp;| <span class="math inline">\({\overline{y}}_{c} = \alpha + \beta'{\overline{x}}_{c} + \mu_{c} + {\overline{\epsilon}}_{c}\)</span>, | (4) |</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\({\overline{y}}_{c}\)</span> is the average of <span class="math inline">\(y_{\text{ct}}\)</span> over time: <span class="math inline">\({\overline{y}}_{c} = \sum_{t}^{}{y_{\text{ct}}/T_{c}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\overline{\epsilon}}_{c}\)</span> is the average of the error term: <span class="math inline">\({\overline{\epsilon}}_{c} = \sum_{t}^{}{\epsilon_{\text{ct}}/T_{c}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Subtracting (4) from (3), it must also be true that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;| | |<br>
&nbsp;| —————————————————————————————————————————————— | — |<br>
&nbsp;| <span class="math inline">\({y_{\text{ct}} - \overline{y}}_{c} = \beta''{(x_{\text{ct}} - \overline{x}}_{c}) + (\epsilon_{\text{ct}} - {\overline{\epsilon}}_{c})\)</span>. | (5) |</p>
<p>These equations are known from panel econometrics textbooks: equation (4) describes the between estimator and equation (5) describes the within estimator, also known as fixed-effects estimator.</p>
<p>Fixed-effects estimations control for time-invariant characteristics of countries such as the extent of size or mountainous terrain. As illustrated in equation (5), the identifying variation comes from within-country deviations from the country-mean. Given standard assumptions on the error term <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\text{ct}}\)</span> (mean<span class="math inline">\(\ 0\)</span>, uncorrelated with itself, uncorrelated with <span class="math inline">\(x_{\text{ct}}\)</span>, uncorrelated with <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{c}\)</span>, and homoscedastic), the within estimator can be estimated as an OLS on (5) or, equivalently, an OLS on equation (1) including country dummy variables. For this study, this equation is estimated using the Stata command <em>xtreg, fe</em>.</p>
<p>The between estimator is given by the OLS estimator on equation (4). This specification cancels out time-differences. The between estimates are based on cross-sectional country differences. Individual-invariant regressors such as time dummies cannot be identified. For this project, this equation is estimated using the Stata command <em>xtreg, be</em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The effect of fuel prices on our three outcomes of interest is likely to be heterogeneous across different countries. However, there is limited data available for most countries, so that unparametrically country-specific estimations proved not feasible. We discard to option to create <em>ad hoc</em> regional groups and estimate group-specific elasticities, as we want a more data-driven methodology. To strike a balance between accounting for heterogeneity and using available data parsimoniously, we estimate elasticities that are linear expressions of several covariates.</p>
<p>The estimation includes interaction terms between fuel prices and the additional variables. For example, if elasticity depends on two more variables, the estimation equation is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;| | |<br>
&nbsp;| —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————- | — |<br>
&nbsp;| <span class="math inline">\(\ln\left( Y_{\text{ct}} \right) = \alpha + \beta_{0}\ln{(p_{\text{ct}})} + \beta_{1}v_{\text{ct}}^{1}\ln{(p_{\text{ct}})} + \beta_{2}v_{\text{ct}}^{2}\ln{(p_{\text{ct}})} + \gamma\ X_{\text{ct}} + \mu_{c} + \ \mu_{t} + \epsilon_{\text{ct}}\)</span>, | (6) |</p>
<p>where the variables are the same as before, and<span class="math inline">\(\ v_{\text{ct}}^{1}\)</span> is the first additional variable influencing elasticity and <span class="math inline">\(v_{\text{ct}}^{2}\)</span> is the second additional variable influencing elasticity. The “country-specific” elasticity estimated is then:</p>
<p>&nbsp;| | |<br>
&nbsp;| —————————————————————————————————————————————— | — |<br>
&nbsp;| <span class="math inline">\({\widehat{\beta}}_{c} = {\widehat{\beta}}_{0} + {\widehat{\beta}}_{1}\overline{v_{c}^{1}} + {\widehat{\beta}}_{2}\overline{v_{c}^{2}}\)</span>, | (7) |</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{v_{c}^{1}}\)</span> is the average across recent years<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> of variable <span class="math inline">\(v_{\text{ct}}^{1}\)</span> for country <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (and analogously for variable <span class="math inline">\(\overline{v_{c}^{2}}\)</span>). In practice, we include not two but five additional variables <span class="math inline">\(v_{\text{ct}}^{k}\)</span>, which we omit here for readability.</p>
<p>We consider 15 candidate variables linked to traffic conditions, demographics and availability of substitutes to private vehicles. The final estimations include only the variables found to be empirically most important.</p>
<p>The selection of covariates <span class="math inline">\(v_{\text{ct}}^{k}\)</span> included in the expressions of elasticities is data-driven using a lasso regression as implemented in Stata command <em>lasso2</em> (Ahrens et al., 2020). The lasso procedure penalizes additional variables/parameters and thereby encourages simple, sparse models, i.e.&nbsp;models with fewer parameters. The algorithm sequentially includes one variable after the other, in an optimized order. The order in which predictors are entered into the model can be interpreted as an indication of the relative predictive power of each predictor.</p>

<p>We are interested in the effect of carbon taxes on accidents. The most classical way of estimating tax impact consists in estimating price elasticity from exogenous price variation. However, some of the literature states that consumers might not react identically to price changes and to tax changes (salience, anticipation of persistence over time).</p>
<p>Therefore, we estimate two sets of elasticities: elasticities with respect to (wrt) fuel prices and wrt fuel taxes. The estimation for elasticity wrt to prices follows the equations above. The estimations for elasticity wrt to taxes include the natural logarithms of both tax-exclusive prices and taxes as two separate variables. The elasticity of interest is then the estimated coefficient of the tax variable. Fuel tax data is only available for a limited amount of countries.</p>

<p>This simple descriptive evidence omits many variables. In particular, the elasticity of demand of private vehicle trips depends on the availability of (and practicability) alternative means of transport. Moreover the resulting congestion depends on whether these alternative means of transport will also be on the road (e.g.&nbsp;buses) or elsewhere (e.g.&nbsp;trains).</p>

<p>Table 7‑2 shows results of the pooled OLS (column 1-3) and within estimator (column 4-6). For each estimator, we compute the coefficient first without and then with covariates included. All of the estimates lie within a similar order of magnitude: the short-run elasticity of congestion wrt fuel price is estimated between -0.08 and -0.29. This is very close to the estimates ranging from -0.12 to -0.29 in (Burger &amp; Kaffine, 2009) and more inelastic than the estimate of -0.35 in (C. A. Dahl, 1979).</p>
<p>The columns 4 and 6 show the results of including additional interaction terms between the fuel price and selected variables. The coefficient of the fuel price is not directly interpretable in this specification. In order to obtain country-specific elasticity estimates, one needs to multiply the coefficients with the country-specific values of the covariates. The results are given below in Section 7.6.1.3.</p>

<p>Table 7‑2 and Table 7‑3 show the results of regressing congestion on fuel prices and covariates, estimating the short-run (within estimator) and long-run (between estimator) elasticities. The parameters of the last column of each table give the results of including interaction terms with relevant covariates, as described by equation (6). The most relevant interaction terms are chosen using lasso regressions (see Section 7.3.8 for methodology).</p>
<p>While using fuel price data for estimating elasticity is standard in the literature, some authors have suggested that consumers react more strongly to changes in fuel taxes than to (equivalent) changes in fuel prices. This hypothesis typically relies on additional salience of taxes, which are often strongly featured in the media, and on expectations about the persistence of the price change into the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, we repeat the same estimations of Table 7‑2 and Table 7‑3 using fuel supply cost and fuel taxes as two separate variables, rather than overall fuel price at the pump. Detailed results are omitted here, but can be found in the MS Excel file appendix to this report.</p>
<p>As a result, we have four elasticity estimates for each country: short-run and long-run, each wrt prices and wrt taxes.</p>
<p>Table 7‑4 shows the lists of variables which are selected by the lasso regression algorithm as the five most relevant covariates for fuel price elasticity of congestion. The elasticities depend on characteristics of the vehicle fleet (number of vehicles per capita, share of motorcycles), on characteristics of the road network (density, speed limits), characteristics of transport substitutes (satisfaction with public transport) and on more general features of society (population size, rule of law indicator, urbanization, share of young people, and others).</p>

<p>Table 7‑8 shows the lists of variables which are selected by the lasso regression algorithm as the five most relevant covariates for the elasticity of accident fatalities, chosen by a data-driven algorithm. Again, the elasticities depend on characteristics of the vehicle fleet, on characteristics of the road network and on more general features of society. In particular, motorcyclist are known to be at particularly high risk for accident injury and death. Classical road safety features such as seat-belt wearing rate, alcohol consumption and maximum speed allowed also play a role. More broadly, GDP and infant mortality rate capture the general development situation of the country, as well as the quality of the country’s health system.</p>

<p>Road damage is measured in CPAT with the road infrastructure expenditure for maintenance, as listed in the WRS. The underlying hypothesis is that all road damage is repaired and therefore captured by the road maintenance budget of the government, as opposed to road investment for the expansion of the road network.</p>
<p>Compared to the other two outcomes previously discussed, road damage presents the particularity to be more dependent on diesel price than on fuel price. Although the differential impact of a carbon tax on fuel and gasoline prices is relatively small, we thus use diesel prices in this section rather than gasoline prices as before.</p>

<p>In the long run, road damage costs react to diesel prices, but the results are not statistically significant as shown on Table 7‑10. In the simple specifications (columns 1 and 2), the elasticity is around -0.3. We use the parameters estimated in the specification including interaction terms (column 3) in order to compute the country-specific elasticities for CPAT presented in the next subsection.</p>

<p>As shown on Table 7‑11, the long-run road damage elasticities depend on structural features of the country’s transportation system (population density, total road network, urbanization), on the vehicle fleet, particularly larger vehicles, and rule of law. Additionally, weather plays an important role for road damage. In particular, minimum temperatures seem to impact the effect of a carbon tax: with less traffic, the effect of low temperatures (frost) on road damage is reduced.</p>

<p>Figure 7‑8 shows that the estimates using fuel taxes suggest less elasticity of road prices wrt fuel taxes than the estimates using prices at the pump. Overall, virtually all estimates lie above -1, suggesting a less than one-to-one reaction of road damage to changes in fuel prices.</p>

<p>We analyze the effect of fuel prices on VKT in order to illustrate one of the main channels through which fuel prices affect congestion, accidents and road damage.

<p>The Road Transport Module takes as an input the road fuel price changes induced by the policy indicated by the user in the dashboard. The module then computes changes in VKT, congestion, accidents and road damage and presents them graphically in the dashboard tab. The information flow is schematized in Figure 7‑9. Although the effect on VKT is computed, the other outcomes are modeled directly as a function of price, in order to avoid having to take functional form assumptions on the influence of VKT and its interaction with the other channels.</p>

<p>In order to graphically represent changes induced by the policy compared to a baseline, we must first establish a baseline forecast. The methodology in CPAT is identical for all three outcomes and VKT. It follows the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a linear forecast based on the average growth rate of available (often incomplete) time series of the variable in the past;</p>
<ul>
<li>The sheet “Tran_Data” contains recent values of the outcome variables as well as the geometric average of growth rates over the past years.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adjust the variable’s linear forecast:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for (forecasted) future deviations from (observed) average past GDP growth using the estimated elasticity of the outcome wrt GDP,</p></li>
<li><p>for (forecasted) future deviations from (observed) average past population growth using the estimated elasticity of the outcome wrt population.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<p>The impact of the carbon policy depends on the change in fuel prices and the variable’s elasticity wrt fuel prices/taxes.</p>
<p>The fuel price is computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the baseline road fuel price is computed as the weighted average of baseline gasoline and diesel price, where the weights equal the respective fuel’s share of baseline total road fuel consumption;</p></li>
<li><p>the policy road fuel price is computed as the weighted average of policy gasoline and diesel price, where the weights equal the respective fuel’s share of policy total road fuel consumption;</p></li>
<li><p>the price change is defined as the ratio of the policy road fuel price over the baseline road fuel price.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We obtain the policy forecast <span class="math inline">\(Y_{t}^{\text{policy}}\)</span> by weighting the price change by the elasticity wrt fuel price <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{p}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Y_{t}^{\text{policy}} = \left( \frac{p^{\text{policy}}}{p^{\text{baseline}}} \right)^{\eta_{p}}Y_{t}^{\text{baseline}}\)</span></p>

<p>For VKT and the three outcomes of interest, we establish similar graphics in the CPAT dashboard.</p>
<p>For each variable, there is a line graph representing the time series of the baseline forecast <span class="math inline">\(Y_{t}^{\text{baseline}}\)</span> and the policy forecast <span class="math inline">\(Y_{t}^{\text{policy}}\)</span>. An example is given in Figure 7‑11.</p>

<p>We then plot a bar chart of the difference between the two lines of Figure 7‑11, representing only the change induced by the policy. An example is given in Figure 7‑12.</p>

<p>Finally, we provide some general evidence of the effect of fuel prices on accident and congestion with a scatter graph. For this scatter graph, we combine cross-sectional country-level information for a given year with year-level information of all available years for the country for which the policy introduction is studied. We also add a linear trendline, which captures the negative correlation between fuel prices and our outcomes. An example is given in Figure 7‑13.</p>

<p>This section explains how CPAT computes the externality cost (per liter of motor fuel) from accidents and congestion. The externality costs are computed as the co-benefits from a carbon tax-induced reduction in motor fuel consumption<em>.</em></p>
<p>The main road transport co-benefits of a carbon tax are a reduction in road accidents (from a reduction in driving, changes in the vehicle fleet, less aggressive driving, etc.) and a reduction in congestion (from a reduction in driving, an increase in car sharing, changes in the vehicle fleet, changes in transport timing decisions, etc.).</p>
<p>Within CPAT, the magnitude of these co-benefits is computed using empirical elasticities from a large historical dataset using econometric panel methods. Given the multitude of channels involved in the final result, the effect on accidents/congestion is not directly proportional to the change in vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) or the change in fuel consumption. For more details on the data and estimation procedure, please refer to the Technical Appendix to the CPAT Road Transport Module.</p>
<p>The externality cost is computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compute baseline forecast of accidents/congestion <strong><em>without policy;</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Baseline forecasts take into account historical growth rates, adjusted for forecasted GDP and population growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Compute policy forecast of accidents/congestion <strong><em>with carbon tax</em></strong> of users choice;</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy forecasts are the baseline forecast adjusted for the fuel price change using the country-specific elasticity; this country-specific elasticity is empirically estimated and measures overall (i.e.&nbsp;across channels) which fuel prices affect accidents/congestion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Compute for policy and baseline scenarios the <strong><em>monetary</em></strong> value of accidents (multiplying fatalities by value of statistical life) and congestion (multiplying time lost in traffic times value of travel time);</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the <strong><em>change</em></strong> in value of accidents/congestion;</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Divide</em></strong> change in value by change in motor fuel consumption from CPAT Mitigation Module.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The externality cost estimate <u>varies each year</u>. For simplicity, only one year is shown as an example in the CPAT Dashboard. As an example Figure 7‑14 shows the graph for Colombia.</p>

<p>Note that the TomTom Traffic Index is defined on the city-level. Therefore, <u>the congestion externality shown in CPAT applies only the urban part of transport</u>. To our knowledge, there is no database measuring congestion levels on the national level. Rural transport is assumed to be free of congestion, i.e.&nbsp;causing zero congestion externality cost.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="caveats"><span class="header-section-number">7.8</span> Caveats</h2>
<p>The CPAT Road Transport Module choses a reduced-form econometric approach to predict the impact of carbon taxes on road transport externalities. Certain caveats must be kept in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The quality of the estimates relies on the quality of available data. For certain countries/years, there is no sufficient data to estimate country-specific transport externality elasticities. In these cases, an internationally estimated default value was used. In the Road Transport Module (Transport tab, section B – elasticities), the user can see whether country-specific or default elasticities have been used.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced-form approaches do not explicitly model the mechanisms. A carbon tax impacts transport demand through various channels: more fuel-efficient use of existing vehicles (e.g.&nbsp;speed, carpooling), switch to less carbon-intensive means of transport (e.g.&nbsp;public transport, non-motorized), reduction in the number/length of trips. The CPAT Road Transport Module cannot disentangle these channels, and can thus not attribute changes in outcomes to individual channels. In particular, carbon taxes make the use of private vehicles more expensive and CPAT cannot measure the loss from the value of non-realized trips.</p></li>
<li><p>General equilibrium effects are not included, such as changes in prices or availability of the outside options. One example frequently discussed are electric vehicles (EVs). Currently, CPAT Road Transport Module does not include EVs. However, an extension of the CPAT Road Transport Module is planned in order to include EVs.</p></li>
<li><p>Elasticities, such as estimated with the CPAT Road Transport Module’s methodology, predict the reaction of outcomes to <em>small</em> changes in carbon taxes. CPAT Road Transport module does not account for potentially non-linear responses to large policy changes. In particular, large policy changes across the world may induce technology changes and relevant changes in the vehicle fleet.</p></li>
<li><p>A uniform carbon tax would impact not only private vehicles but also lower-emitting transport modes such as buses. An increase in the price of public transit could have a negative impact on people’s ability to reach jobs and essential services thereby contributing to fragmented labor markets and loss of welfare. Since low-income households are more likely to reduce their number of trips (instead of switching means of transport), a carbon tax could reduce their access to economic opportunities and thereby impact inequality. While it is not within the scope of CPAT1.0, understanding the potential impact of carbon pricing on access to employment is important to inform the development of more targeted policies that can offset any such negative distributional effects of a carbon tax on transit accessibility.</p></li>

<p>We constantly update the dataset used to estimate the parameters behind the CPAT Road Transport Module. So far, CPAT reflects the last complete update using the WRS 2020 edition. A further update using the WRS 2021 edition is in progress.</p>
<p>As we are using proprietary data, we had to transform all non-shareable (proprietary) data into a shareable form. For the Road Transport Module, this was mainly achieved by using (near-future) forecast based on historic data forecasts, instead of the historic data itself.</p>
<p>We have further added estimates of the externality cost per liter of motor fuel, described in Section 7.7.5.</p>
<p>We are still working on two features not yet implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Integration of electric vehicles (EVs)</em>: The introduction of EVs and their necessary charging infrastructure is relatively slow, especially in developing countries. So far, we have struggled to get sufficient data for credible estimations. Nevertheless, we are aware that EVs may fundamentally change the link between traffic (including accidents and congestion) and carbon taxes. We are thus working on a methodology to include EVs and EV-supporting policies into CPAT.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Between-module consistency</em>: Currently, the VKT estimates in the CPAT Road Transport Module are not linked to the transport CO<sub>2</sub> in the Mitigation Module. In fact, VKT and CO<sub>2</sub> may follow distinct paths as technology and driving habits (e.g.&nbsp;number of people in a vehicle) change. Nevertheless, future versions of CPAT will improve the coordination between modules.</p></li>
